- move to curl
- react on http error codes like HTTP 302 (redirection)
- implement https support (after moving to curl as curl can handle ssl connections by itself)
- think about how to implement the parsers for the different web sites or if a general one is possible
- implement the parsers by using libxml2

DONE:
- think about multithreaded architecture using std::thread (c++11)
