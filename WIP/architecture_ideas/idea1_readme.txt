- probably total bullshit...
- I really wonder if we need a separate server which does only downloading and parsing of resources - (maybe later if we develop a web scrawler...)
- are the users also able to add new newssites, can they maybe even give us hints how to parse the websits
- what is required for all the AI stuff :-), seriously I currently don't know anything about that part
- is a combined api for administration and the users secure enough??? I kind of like the idea that the admin interface is only useable in the internal network, but we should be able to block it in the firewall as restful-apis use regular url's

(made this in only 15min, so don't expect a professional result XD)
