- General: create a bash startup script for all nodes
- General: create an overview dashboard for the whole server

- Core: don't send documents to link without both named entities and LSA vector

- Link: add more clustering methods
- Link: think about different "seeds" than just the search term in LSA space

- Link: find a way to retrieve linked entities

- NERStrategy: add TF-IDF vector *for entities only*
- LSAStrategy: refactor such that one node handles conversion, and sends samples to a second node to update the model

- Collect: create Twitter data source
- Collect: Find more RSS feeds



VISION, IDEAS AND OUTLOOK (ordered roughly by when we should implement each feature)
    - use entity tf-idf to find important entities in a document
        - use this to do awesome NE overlap queries (to discover more instances when important actors appear together)

    - add more user interactivity:
        - manually editing the graph
            - means: right click to expand
                - expand has options: NE overlap, similarity search, maybe things like specific sentence search
            - everything should be deliberate
            - don't just mess with the graph automatically when a node is clicked by accident!
        - taking notes
        - saving, loading the graph
        - sharing and collaborating on a graph

    - find a way to organize articles by broader topics (market sectors, if you will)

    - add MORE VISUALIZATIONS
       - graph is cool, but we need more
       - timeline, map
       - some sort of statistics about some articles or individual entities

    - display stories that may interest a user on their landing page (think facebook wall but useful and organized)

    - automatically discover insights and anomalies
        - this is really the final goal: holist should highlight information that you don't even know is important
