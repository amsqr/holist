			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/files/2012/05/tele1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-873" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="President Barack Obama's teleprompter is pictured during his statement with the White House press corps in the East Room of the White House in Washington" src="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/files/2012/05/tele1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>Having  secured the nominations of their parties, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney  have set their campaign throttles to late-spring idle with a speech  here, a speech there, a commencement <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/obamas-barnard-commencement-speech--text/2012/05/14/gIQAnZtPPU_blog.html">address</a> over there, and<a href="http://saintpetersblog.com/2012/05/details-about-mitt-romneys-visit-to-st-pete-and-tampa/"> fundraisers</a> and soft <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obama-talks-gay-marriage-politics-pop-culture-view/story?id=16350683">TV</a> appearances everywhere. Eventually, the two candidates will stop  coasting, but until they do, reporters will continue to lard their  work with exercises in meta-journalism, such as today&#8217;s 1,800-word  Politico piece, &#8220;<a href="http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=3628E027-1070-4BBB-B59D-B827B9AAC04E">Obama and Romney&#8217;s common foe</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The  common foe, don&#8217;t you know, is the press! According to Politico&#8217;s  Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush, Barack and Mitt both &#8220;disdain&#8221; the  &#8220;political news media&#8221; because they believe reporters are &#8220;eager to  vaporize them for the sheer sport of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is  there anything new about presidents and presidential candidates having  bad feelings for the press? Does nobody recall John McCain&#8217;s low regard  for the <em>New York Times</em><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/press_box/2008/02/mccains_smoking_blonde.html"> coverage</a> of his 2008 campaign? Or of George W. Bush&#8217;s attitude toward the press?  Bill Clinton&#8217;s scorn? George H.W. Bush&#8217;s hatred? Carter&#8217;s? Nixon&#8217;s?  Johnson&#8217;s? Sometimes  candidates do charm the press, as McCain did in 2000, and the anti-war  candidates of 1968 and 1972, but it’s the exception, never the rule.</p>
<p>No,  there is nothing new about presidents and presidential candidates having bad  feelings about the press, something the Politico piece readily admits. As  Haberman and Thrush write: &#8220;Media-hating has been an occupational  hazard among presidential candidates for decades, and it’s deeply  self-serving.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then,  Haberman and Thrush abandon the idea of media-hating being a campaign  constant in their next paragraph, writing: &#8220;But 2012 is shaping up to be  an especially sour cycle for the campaigns and the media, amplifying  the natural tension between candidates and the press in the absence of  an uplifting storyline.&#8221;</p>
<p>Attacking  Politico for contradicting itself or for confusing a lightning bug with  lightning (hat tip to Mr. Twain) may seem to be a fool’s errand. The  people who edit and write for the site know good journalism from bad,  but that self-knowledge doesn’t prevent them from serving half-baked,  rancid dishes like this. Politico, which has become influential and  ubiquitous in our political culture, depends on patrons like me to send  entrees like this back to the kitchen and to summon the health  inspector to do his thing. Only then can America be safe.</p>
<p>The evidence presented by Politico that this campaign is &#8220;shaping up to be especially sour&#8221; is so thin it almost vanishes. Obama has said vague things about being disappointed by the press, such as in his commencement<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/obamas-barnard-commencement-speech--text/2012/05/14/gIQAnZtPPU_blog.html"> address</a> at Barnard College, and he delivered a<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2012/04/28/president-obama-white-house-correspondents-dinner"> cheap shot</a> about Huffington Post&#8217;s aggressive aggregation in his White House  Correspondents&#8217; Association Dinner speech. But that hardly constitutes  press hatred. Straining to come up with material, the Politico piece  quotes David Plouffe&#8217;s <em>The Audacity to Win</em>, the Obama adviser&#8217;s 2009 memoir about the 2008  campaign, on press-candidate relations. Exactly how Plouffe&#8217;s views on his candidate&#8217;s relations with the press in the last campaign help show candidate-press relations approaching some new &#8220;sourness&#8221; plateau in this campaign is not explained.</p>
<p>Indeed,  it shows that Politico doesn&#8217;t really have the goods to prove its  thesis, as the piece zigs back to note that there is at least one outlet  the president admires: An anonymous &#8220;onetime Obama press adviser&#8221; tells  Haberman and Thrush that Obama &#8220;likes the N<em>ew York Times</em>,&#8221; which he thinks is &#8220;serious&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;the rest of you guys.&#8221; Also, Obama told <em>Rolling Stone</em> that he read all the <em>Times </em>columnists.</p>
<p>Perhaps  Politico has conflated Obama&#8217;s dislike of Politico into a hatred of the  entire press corps? I hope Haberman and Thrush pursue this angle with  the anonymous onetime Obama press adviser.</p>
<p>Establishing  that Romney hates the press should be a cinch, but Politico doesn&#8217;t  even try. It reports that Ann Romney didn&#8217;t like a 1994 profile done on  her by the <em>Boston Globe</em> during  Mitt&#8217;s failed run for the Senate. That would be admissible evidence if  Politico were attempting to show that 1994 was the nastiest year in  press-candidate relations, but that&#8217;s not what the site is up to here,  is it? It also tells us that Romney &#8220;walled&#8221; himself off from beat  reporters during the primary campaign, that he has kept reporters off  his &#8220;rope line&#8221; to prevent them from asking questions, that his camp  thinks the <em>Washington Post</em> story  about his Cranbrook days was a hit job, that he dislikes the extreme scrutiny  (such as what brand of jeans he&#8217;s wearing) and that he has a &#8220;handful of  favorites&#8221; in the press, including <em>Washington Post</em> blogger Jennifer Rubin. This sounds less like conflict to me than baseline candidate-press relations.</p>
<p>As  presented by Politico, Romney&#8217;s most urgent media problem isn&#8217;t the  conventional press, it&#8217;s the world of conservative bloggers, &#8220;who view  him as a moderate,&#8221; as well as other conservative writers. Only Politico  would dare conflate a Republican candidate&#8217;s inability to please  conservative bloggers and conservative writers into confirmation of a  candidate&#8217;s poor relations with the press.</p>
<p>Veteran  White House reporter James Deakin posited the inevitability of  confrontations between the president and the press in his 1984 book <em>Straight Stuff: The Reporters, the White House, and the Truth</em> and documented them in their many flavors. Likewise, presidential  candidates and the press are equally apt to mix it up, and do, as  readers of Teddy White and his successors have learned.</p>
<p>When  Politico asserts that &#8220;Romneyland, like Obamaland, is inherently  mistrustful of the press corps,&#8221; it&#8217;s hardly breaking news. Of course  Romneyland and Obamaland are inherently mistrustful of the press corps,  as were Santorumland, Gingrichland and Perryland, and for good reason.  It&#8217;s the job of the press to expose things about candidates that they  would rather not have you hear.</p>
<p>As  a practical matter, voters and readers need never worry about the state  of candidate-press relations. Until, of course, the unfortunate day  comes when Politico reports everybody is getting along swell.</p>
<p>******</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/in-new-ben-bradlee-biography-bob-woodward-is-the-star/2012/05/04/gIQA4uQk1T_print.html"> review</a> originally appeared in the </em>Washington Post<em> on May 6, 2012, and is being reprinted by permission of the </em>Post<em>.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/files/2012/05/truth.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-865" title="truth" src="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/files/2012/05/truth.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>Jeff Himmelman uses his new book, <em>Yours in Truth</em>, to take shots at Bob Woodward, Carl Bernstein and their 1974 book, <em>All the President’s Men</em>.  But Himmelman’s fire does not come from the usual redoubt of Watergate  revisionism. He is a former researcher for Woodward, one who worked so  diligently on <em>Maestro </em>the reporter’s 2001 book about Alan Greenspan, that Woodward gushed about him in his<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Apq464YfTA0C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=%22my+full-time+collaborator+at+every+step+of+this+book+--+reporting,+writing,+and+editing%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GQmiT-S9FYmt6AHktZj3CA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22my%20full-time%20collaborator%20at%20every%20step%20of%20this%20book%20--%20reporting%2C%20writing%2C%20and%20editing%22&amp;f=false"> author’s note</a>.</p>
<p>“Jeff  Himmelman,” he wrote, “was my full-time collaborator at every step of  this book—reporting, writing and editing. &#8230; A truly remarkable man of  unusual maturity, brainpower and charm, Jeff is an original thinker who  retains a deep sense of idealism. &#8230; This book would never have been  completed without him, and it is his as much as mine. I consider him a  friend for life.”</p>
<p>After he finishes reading <em>Yours in Truth</em>, Woodward will probably consider a different sort of life sentence for Himmelman.</p>
<p>Although  former <em>Washington Pos</em>t executive editor Benjamin C. Bradlee gets top  billing in Himmelman’s book, he plays a supporting role, not the lead.  The book is chockablock with Bradlee—drawing on more than 60 boxes  containing his papers and other private archives, and countless hours of  interviews with him and his colleagues, to tell the story of his life,  which Bradlee already covered in his 1995 autobiography, <em>A Good Life</em>. But the genuine subject is Woodward.</p>
<p>Himmelman publicly signaled as much last Sunday when, before the book’s release, he published an excerpt on the Web site of <em>New York</em> magazine. He capitalizes on an unpublished 1990 interview in which  Bradlee discussed his “little problem with Deep Throat,” the code name  for<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/31/AR2005053100655.html"> Woodward’s legendary Watergate source</a>,  Mark Felt. Of the clandestine parking-garage meetings with Deep Throat  that Woodward convened by moving a flower pot on his apartment balcony,  Bradlee expressed doubts. “There’s a residual fear in my soul that that  isn’t quite straight,” he said.</p>
<p>Himmelman’s  other blast criticizes Woodward and Bernstein for being less than  honest about how successful they were in their efforts to interview  members of a Watergate grand jury. The duo has long maintained that they  did not reap any information from the grand jurors they approached. But  a memo in Bradlee’s papers, written by Bernstein at the time of the  Watergate investigation, indicates that they did talk to a grand juror.</p>
<p>Such shots land hard on Woodward and Bernstein, but will they cause lasting damage?</p>
<p>Himmelman  attempts no deep forensic study of what he found in Bradlee’s boxes,  contrary to what you’d expect of an investigative reporter challenging  the legend of Woodward and Bernstein. Instead, he gives the reader long,  descriptive and dialogue-rich passages in which he confronts Bradlee —  and then Woodward and Bradlee—with his findings. It’s almost like  reading one of the spectacular fly-on-the-wall scenes from a Woodward  book, except in <em>Yours in Truth</em>, all the flies are on the record and  the stakes aren’t as quite as global or spectacular.</p>
<p>Say what you will about Woodward and his reportorial techniques—and many journalists and scholars have weighed in—<em>All the President’s Men</em> has withstood rigorous scrutiny over the past four decades. Entire  books have been dedicated to its examination. While its treatment of  Watergate is not complete or perfect, the book is a powerful document of  the investigation.</p>
<p>One of the more appealing aspects of <em>All the President’s Men</em> is the authors’ willingness to portray themselves in a  less-than-flattering light. Bernstein is shown trampling ethics and  possibly breaking the law by asking an employee at a credit card  company, and another at a telephone company, to lift records. Woodward  repeatedly expands his agreement with Deep Throat, phoning him after  promising to stay away from the phone and quoting him anonymously in the  paper after vowing never to do so. And by quoting Deep Throat at  length, <em>All the President’s Men</em> violates the sourcing arrangement completely.</p>
<p>So  the idea that Woodward and Bernstein would push the envelope to get a  story is not revelatory: They confess to their methodology in their  book.</p>
<p>What, then, to make of Bradlee’s doubts? Of the grand jury memo?</p>
<p>As I read Bradlee, what he’s doubting are the highly dramatic scenes in <em>All the President’s Men</em>,  not the Watergate findings in the book. Arranging flower pots to set up  meetings with a source inside a parking garage may sound like something  out of Austin Powers,  but let’s remember that Deep Throat’s first suggested signal was for  Woodward to leave his apartment drapes open, which Woodward rejected  because he likes sunshine. Also, the reporter devised an alternate  method to set up the meetings: a telephone call that did not identify  him.</p>
<p>The  skullduggery behind the flower-pot signals and coded messages  completely fit the man Deep Throat was, one experienced in  counterintelligence. Deep Throat may have thought the tradecraft made  him safe, or he may have used it to impress Woodward with what an  important, inviolable source he was.</p>
<p>Woodward and Bernstein fill <em>All the President’s Men</em> with their heavy breathing, which is one of the things that makes it so  readable. For instance, after Deep Throat warns Woodward that his  inquiries are putting lives in danger, Woodward and Bernstein storm  Bradlee’s home after 2 a.m. with the news. The next day, the two  reporters have a meeting with The <em>Post</em>’s top editors, Bradlee included,  where, as Woodward writes in <em>The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate’s Deep Throat</em>,  veteran editor Richard Harwood “thought we had finally gone around the  bend and that our coverage was nearing the edge of fantasy, a kind of  paranoid delusion of persecution.”</p>
<p>Yes,  the pair overdramatized their story, but it’s likely they considered  their book a form of cinema verite. If your best source told you your  life was in danger, you might appear overdramatic and delusional to  others.</p>
<p>Himmelman’s  grand jury revelation is difficult to parse because it’s impossible to  determine what he’s found and what precise deceit Woodward and Bernstein  allegedly committed. Himmelman writes that a Bernstein source  code-named “Z” in <em>All the President’s Men</em> was “a grand juror in disguise,” which contradicts the reporters’ claim  that they did not get any information from the grand jurors they  contacted. Woodward and Bernstein<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/achenblog/post/woodward-and-bernstein-respond-to-himmelman/2012/04/30/gIQAt9irrT_blog.html"> responded to Himmelman’s charge</a> in full on The <em>Post</em>’s Web site last week, conceding that Z was a grand  juror but that Bernstein didn’t know that until he visited her and she  volunteered it. They insist that they elided her grand juror status in  their book to protect her identity.</p>
<p>How important was Z? Woodward loosely equates her cryptic hints with those of Deep Throat (and other sources) in a scene in <em>All the President’s Men</em> in which he visits Sen. Sam Ervin, chairman of the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Campaign Practices.</p>
<p>Himmelman writes, “If they were willing to dress Z up, might they not have hung something extra on Deep Throat, too?”</p>
<p>It  would take the brain of a Jesuit tandemed with that of a Talmudic  scholar to answer this question. Does masking the identity of Z, along  with a lack of candor over what they learned from the grand jury, mean  that Woodward and Bernstein would have fabulized about Deep Throat? Not  in my mind. At best, Himmelman appears to have caught the reporters in  either a small lie or a narrow truth about Z and the grand jury. That  can’t lead to faking facts about Deep Throat unless Himmelman can point  to something stronger than the doubts in Bradlee’s 1990 interview—which  he doesn’t.</p>
<p>It’s  a pity that Himmelman didn’t confront Woodward and Bernstein over the Z  memo for his book and give them a chance to mount a sustained defense.  Instead, he conducted an unrewarding interview with them via conference  call for the <em>New York</em> magazine excerpt.</p>
<p>If  the Woodward and Bernstein story is the meat in this sandwich,  Bradlee’s career, before and after Watergate, is the bread. Himmelman  admits that some of the bread he serves is pretty stale, conceding that  “nearly all of the good stuff” from the 1990 interviews that Bradlee  conducted with his researcher “went wholesale into Ben’s memoir.” The  bread isn’t tasteless, though. Himmelman makes better use of material  from the decades-long Grant Study of Adult Development of Harvard  students, of which Bradlee was one, than Bradlee did in <em>A Good Life</em>.</p>
<p>He  also brings readers up to date on Bradlee’s life since 1995, when his  memoir appeared, though the audience for the period must be limited. If  you’ve read <em>A Good Life</em> and Katharine Graham’s Pulitzer Prize-winning autobiography, <em>Personal History</em>, this book will strike you as a bit of a yard sale of the Bradlee archives.</p>
<p>It  didn’t have to be that way. The book appears to have originated as an  idea of Bradlee’s wife, Sally Quinn, who wanted her husband to write  another book about himself and drafted Himmelman as his assistant. He  was a credible choice, having impressed Woodward and aided Ben and  Sally’s son, Quinn, in writing his memoir, <em>A Different Life: Growing Up Learning Disabled and Other Adventures</em>.</p>
<p>Had  the archives been dropped on a master of narrative journalism, such as  Richard Ben Cramer, or a press scholar, instead of a trusted intimate of  the Bradlee family, perhaps a great work could have surfaced. Instead,  we’re stuck with a book that has the flavor of a Woodward production  without any of the substance.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[James Hershberg's exhaustive new book – titled "Marigold" – on the 1966 breakdown of Vietnam War talks teaches that the real news is often who is leaking, and that’s news that can't often be found in newspapers. ]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/files/2012/05/Photo-of-James-G-Hershberg.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-848" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="Photo of James G Hershberg" src="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/files/2012/05/Photo-of-James-G-Hershberg-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>Every  leaker of information has an agenda. The leaker can be an honest  whistleblower, a spinner, a junior Machiavelli, a nut job, a misinformed  flunky or a combination of several of the above. But with every  trickle of privileged information, the leaker invites other interested  parties to leak their side of the story, setting institutions against  institutions and publications against publications.</p>
<p>An extraordinarily well documented account of battling leaks appears in<em><a href="http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?id=20877"> Marigold: The Lost Chance for Peace in Vietnam</a></em>, a  new book by George Washington University history professor James G.  Hershberg. Professor Hershberg&#8217;s exhaustive book – and by exhaustive I mean  936 pages long – draws on declassified diplomatic cables, foreign  archives, countless interviews, and reporters&#8217; private notes to  recount the breakdown of secret Polish-Italian efforts in  1966 – code-named &#8220;Marigold&#8221; – that hoped to coax the United States and North  Vietnam into direct peace negotiations.</p>
<p>Like all history lessons, <em>Marigold</em> charges  a high price for admission. If you’re not already a student of the  Vietnam War or weren’t reading newspapers in the 1960s, the players will  sound sketchy and the dispute ephemeral. But I  promise a payoff: <em>Marigold</em> etches  a template that can provide relief for today’s news consumers who find  themselves perplexed by dueling accounts in competing publications. It  teaches that sometimes the real news is often who is leaking, and that’s  news that can&#8217;t often be found in newspapers.</p>
<p>Hershberg explained the importance of &#8220;Marigold&#8221; in a recent conversation with me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marigold  seemed to be on the verge of a breakthrough to open direct talks  between the U.S. and North Vietnam in December 1966, when about 6,250  Americans had been killed in Vietnam as opposed to the more than 58,000 who  would be killed by the end of the war,&#8221; he said. But the talks collapsed  spectacularly in the middle of that month. The Poles (and implicitly  the North Vietnamese) blamed the resumption of U.S. bombing of Hanoi for  Marigold&#8217;s end. The Americans disputed this, saying that no pledge not  to bomb had been made.</p>
<p>&#8220;It  was a policy dispute, but internationalized as a diplomatic dispute  which turned into an exercise in competitive leaking, first to various  governments and third parties in secret, but which gradually made its  way out to the front pages of the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>New York Times</em> and contributed in important ways to President Lyndon Johnson&#8217;s widening credibility gap,&#8221; Hershberg said.</p>
<p>Polish-U.S.  recriminations started immediately after the talks ended. The U.S.  ambassador to Poland, John A. Gronouski, met with Polish Foreign  Minister Adam Rapacki in Warsaw on Dec. 19 to give the Poles grief over  the aborted negotiations. An outraged Rapacki responded that the collapse  was Washington&#8217;s fault. Warsaw had, after all, warned Washington not to  bomb.</p>
<p>Then  came the war of leaks, pitting the Poles against the Americans, a duel  that eventually made its way into the press. Rapacki set a course of  revenge-by-leaks, ordering up documents &#8220;enshrining Warsaw&#8217;s version of  events, suitable for presentation to third parties,&#8221; Hershberg writes.  Meanwhile, the Americans tried spinning U.N. Secretary-General U Thant, a  former journalist, with their version of the peace-negotiation breakup  in the form of a letter from U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Arthur Goldberg,  which was made public. The<em> New York Times </em>constructed a pro-Washington<a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F70F17FB3E5A12718DDDA90A94DA415B868AF1D3"> editorial</a> from the letter in its Dec. 20, 1966, edition, which had to have  pleased the U.S. government. At about the same time, the Poles were  leaking their side of the story to Pope Paul VI, who had previously  attempted to broker peace. When the Poles learned that the U.S. was  dancing with U Thant, they cut in for a spin of their own on Dec. 23,  leaking their Marigold dossier to the secretary-general.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then  the U.N. secretary-general, for his own reasons, tells the Canadians, and  tells the French, and then it <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/files/2012/05/marigold_cover.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-849" title="marigold_cover" src="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/files/2012/05/marigold_cover-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>takes a couple of days for word to get to  the Americans,&#8221; said Hershberg. The U.S. response was, Hershberg said:  &#8220;Hey, the Poles are leaking their side of the story, so we had better  start counter-leaking!&#8221; So as 1967 commenced, the Americans took their  pissing match to the British, the Canadians, the pope, and others to  contest the Polish version.</p>
<p>The Poles escalated by talking to journalist-activist Norman Cousins, then editor of the <em>Saturday Review</em>.  In a memo, Cousins memorialized the Polish diplomatic visitor to his  Park Avenue apartment as &#8220;Mr. X.&#8221; The same diplomat also spoke of  Marigold to Canadian diplomats and others during his New York visit.</p>
<p>The first journalistic product of the leaks appeared in the Feb. 2, 1967, <em>Washington Post</em>,  where U.N. correspondent Robert H. Estabrook&#8217;s short piece about the dead  talks reported an &#8220;informed source&#8221; saying, &#8220;The Americans bungled it.&#8221;  Other evidence of the leaks working their way into the press: Two weeks  earlier, columnist Drew Pearson learned from an unnamed &#8220;Communist  source&#8221; that U.S. bombings had scuttled the negotiations, but he wrote  no story after Ambassador Goldberg warned him off it. The <em>New York Daily News</em>, the <em>Boston Globe</em> and the <em>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em> were also nibbling on the story.</p>
<p>Estabrook piece&#8217;s gave the Johnson administration a fit. Had it been as legal to bomb <em>Post</em> headquarters  at 15th and L Streets NW as it was to bomb Hanoi, LBJ might have  ordered a sortie. Secretary of State Dean Rusk plotted immediate damage  control to nullify Estabrook. In private, he blamed the Poles for the  end of the talks, and proposed asking <em>Washington Post</em> editor  Russ Wiggins to send Estabrook back to re-report the story, presumably  to his liking. When Estabrook published a more detailed piece on the  topic, which ran at the top of Page One, Rusk phoned Wiggins to complain  about the &#8220;highly fragmentary&#8221; piece of &#8220;Polish propaganda distortion.&#8221;  (As it turns out, Estabrook&#8217;s key source was a Danish diplomat, with an  off-the-record U Thant session and hints from the Canadians helping  assemble the story.)</p>
<p>Wiggins was editor of both the <em>Post</em> news  pages and the paper&#8217;s editorial page, which still supported the Johnson  war. He dutifully expressed Rusk&#8217;s views by publishing a Feb. 8, 1967,  editorial that essentially told <em>Post</em> readers  to ignore the Estabrook scoops. The editorial called the &#8220;recent peace  rumors … less serious omens of peace than significant as part of a  worldwide propaganda effort.&#8221; Wiggins was way too close to the  administration. Upon leaving the <em>Post</em> in  late 1968 he accepted Johnson&#8217;s nomination to serve as U.S. ambassador  to the U.N. &#8220;The president and the editor were friends, and Mr. Wiggins  was chosen because of his support of the president&#8217;s policies in  Vietnam,&#8221; Wiggins&#8217;s<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/printedition/ob/wiggins_ob20.htm"> obituary</a> in the <em>Post</em> reads.</p>
<p>The battle of the leaks climaxed on May 9, 1967, when the <em>New York Times</em><a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20C1FFC3B5B1A7B93CBA9178ED85F438685F9"> published</a> on Page One an article by Associated Press reporter John M. Hightower  titled &#8220;4-Month U.S. Bid Ignored by Hanoi.&#8221; The piece took the Johnson  administration&#8217;s line on the failed negotiations, ripping the Poles and  blaming Hanoi for impeding the peace talks. &#8220;Spoon-fed&#8221; is what  Hershberg calls the article, which attributed its findings to U.S. &#8220;high  officials.&#8221; Indeed, Rusk&#8217;s private papers show that Rusk and key aide  William Bundy midwifed the story. On May 5, Hershberg reports, Rusk  invited Hightower to bring him a draft of the piece. A Rusk office memo in  the National Archives reads: &#8220;Sec. thought if H. wished to pull it  together Sec. maybe could tidy it up for H.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rusk  alerted others in the administration of his Marigold leak to Hightower,  and a background briefing for reporters supporting the piece was  authorized. As an AP exclusive, the story ran in hundreds of newspapers  across the country and around the world, almost inspiring the Poles to  leak more.</p>
<p>Who was the reading public to believe? A team from the <em>Los Angeles Time</em>s,  including most notably Stuart H. Loory and David Kraslow, essentially  found in favor of Estabrook in their newspaper, with the duo going on to  write the 1968 book about the affair and other dashed efforts to end  the war, <em>The Secret Search for Peace in Vietnam</em>.  But even as Loory and Kraslow were conducting their inquiry, the White  House was leaking selectively to the press, including the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>Life</em> magazine, to preempt their account. Marigold – as well as Loory and  Kraslow&#8217;s book – got lost in the shuffle when another peace initiative  flowered in spring 1968, with direct negotiations commencing later that  year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The  reporting of Marigold was somewhat unusual in that it involved not only  sources with various viewpoints within the executive branch, and  between the executive branch and Congress – note the key leak by Senate  Foreign Relations Committee Chair [William] Fulbright&#8217;s top aide, Carl  Marcy – but also involving multiple governments, on both sides of the  Iron Curtain, especially Poland, Italy, Canada, Britain, France and the U.N. secretary-general,&#8221; said Hershberg.</p>
<p>These  multiple points of entry gave reporters who were willing to do the work  a way to get the story. Even the &#8220;spoon-fed&#8221; Hightower, in Hershberg&#8217;s  opinion, probably did some quality reporting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t want to pretentiously pontificate, but certainly [Marigold is]  another cautionary tale for consumers of national security journalism to  read any reporting on controversial, still-classified, national  security subjects with some skepticism – and to try to read multiple  publications likely to obtain information from multiple, and varying,  sources,&#8221; said Hershberg.</p>
<p>Hershberg&#8217;s  book illustrates the perils that await not just reporters who become  captive to their official sources (as did Wiggins and Hightower) but the  readers who rely on co-opted journalists. Like a trusty decoder ring, <em>Marigold</em> also  provides readers with an interpretive framework to understand dueling  coverage that will always be with us. Think of Marigold, Hershberg said,  when reading news accounts about the state of Iran&#8217;s nuclear program,  which like Marigold is &#8220;a murky classified dispute&#8221; with many  international players.</p>
<p>&#8220;It  obviously makes sense to track not only U.S. publications but also  Israeli and other interested countries&#8217; publications,&#8221; said Hershberg.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The UK government's declaration that Murdoch is unfit to run a broadcasting company might look like a fatal blow. But Murdoch has always been most effective with his back against the wall. Here's how he might get out of this mess. ]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/files/2012/05/report.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-838" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="A reporter picks up a copy of the report by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport into News International and phone hacking before a news conference at Portcullis House in London" src="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/files/2012/05/report-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a>The publication today of Parliament&#8217;s 121-page <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/culture-media-sport/Final_Report_VOL_I_News_Int_and_Phone-hacking.pdf">report</a> (pdf) on phone hacking has the British press all but publishing  obituaries for Rupert Murdoch. The report damns him for turning &#8220;a blind  eye&#8221; to the scandal of phone hacking at his companies, News Corporation  and News International.</p>
<p>Murdoch  is not &#8220;a fit person to exercise the stewardship of a major  international company,&#8221; the report concludes, leveling a hammer to the  media baron&#8217;s head. As the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/9238718/What-does-the-Select-Committee-report-mean-for-Murdochs-empire.html"><em>Telegrap</em>h</a> interprets this finding, BSkyB, the UK satellite broadcaster that  Murdoch owns 39.1 percent of, is &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; to a challenge from the  regulators at<a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk/"> Ofcom</a>.  If the regulators applied their &#8220;fit and proper&#8221; test to BSkyB, they  could cancel its broadcasting license, order News Corp. to reduce its  holdings in the broadcaster and oust Rupert&#8217;s son James Murdoch from  its board of directors. The<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17898029"> BBC</a> seconded the <em>Telegraph</em>&#8216;s take, and the <em>Telegraph</em> and the <em><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/may/01/phone-hacking-report-wilful-blindness">Guardian</a></em> speculate  that the report will echo in the United States, triggering criminal  prosecutions and unending damage to Murdoch&#8217;s corporate reputation here.</p>
<p>Murdoch&#8217;s corporate <a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2012/05/5811265/news-corp-responds-parliamentary-report-declaring-rupert-murdoch-unfit">counterattack</a> today states that News Corp. has &#8220;already confronted and … acted on the failings documented in the Report,&#8221; insisting that the company has righted all the wrongs. In a<a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/01/murdoch-responds-in-internal-news-corp-memo/"> memo</a> to his 50,000 employees, Murdoch remained defiant, minimizing corporate  wrongdoing and maximizing the corrective measures his company has  taken.</p>
<p>Even more bad news for Murdoch will arrive when the<a href="http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/"> Leveson Inquiry</a> concludes its investigation and issues recommendations for future press regulation.</p>
<p>And yet, Murdoch performs best when his back is against the wall. He won  his war against the printers at Wapping in 1986, he survived his  bankers&#8217; foreclosure notices in 1990, and has triumphed over other  scandals and calamities in past years by remaining cool. Here&#8217;s the path  his escape route may take.</p>
<p><strong>Blame the politicians.</strong> Murdoch has plenty of fodder to portray himself a victim of feuding politicians. His corporate <a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2012/05/5811265/news-corp-responds-parliamentary-report-declaring-rupert-murdoch-unfit">minions</a> are already denouncing Parliament&#8217;s report as &#8220;highly partisan&#8221; and  &#8220;divided … along party lines.&#8221; Indeed, the six Labour and Liberal  Democrat members voted in support of the report, and four Tories voted  against. Conservative MP Louise Mensch, who served on the report  committee, carried the torch for Team Murdoch in her comments to the <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/05/damning-report-of-rupert-murdoch-opens-a-partisan-divide.html">press</a>:  “It will be correctly seen as a partisan report, and will have lost a  very great deal of its credibility, which is an enormous shame.”</p>
<p>But  this partisan explanation is too simple. Murdoch doesn&#8217;t really have  any politics – unless expediency qualifies as politics. He supported the  Conservatives when Margaret Thatcher was around, shifted to Labour when  Tony Blair rose, and cut back to rejoin the Tories again to catch the  David Cameron surge. He&#8217;s not partisan, he&#8217;s for Rupert Murdoch! If he  can convince enough people that Labour is fighting the Conservatives and  using him as the proxy, he&#8217;ll gain footing.</p>
<p><strong>Rally  the faithful</strong>. I know what you’re thinking. Rally what faithful? Who  in the UK has faith in Murdoch? The only Murdoch rally that will  attract crowds will be his funeral. But if Rupert Murdoch is such an unmitigated monster, if he has no constituency at all, then why hasn&#8217;t the British reading public turned on him?</p>
<p>Murdoch has a sixth sense of how far he can push the public. They might have dragged him through the streets and hanged him last summer after the <em>Guardian</em> broke the Milly Dowler phone-hacking scandal had he not outwitted them by driving a stake into the chest of <em>News of the World</em>, his offending (and very popular) tabloid. As a<em><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/apr/28/murdoch-sun-internet-regulation?newsfeed=true"> Guardian</a></em> editorial wistfully noted last month, UK readers have continued to support Murdoch&#8217;s surviving newspapers, the <em>Times</em>, circulation 390,000; the <em>Sunday Times</em>, circulation 1 million; and the <em>Sun</em> tabloid, circulation 2.6 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a market,&#8221; the <em>Guardian</em> editorialists wrote, &#8220;for the output of phone-hacking, media harassment  and other unethical practices.&#8221; Although the millions who read  Murdoch&#8217;s papers aren&#8217;t dittoheads, they can be moved to side with  Murdoch if he doesn&#8217;t overdo his appeal to them. He can rightly say  that he folded his offending newspaper and fired its entire staff – both  those guilty and those innocent of phone hacking – in a personal, and corporate, act of  contrition worth <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/nov/03/murdoch-news-corp-losses-news-of-world-bskyb-broadcaster">$91 million</a>.</p>
<p>Murdoch  could reshape the new report and the forthcoming Leveson findings as  attacks on his readers, as attempts of Labour politicians to drive his  people-pleasing journalism out of the country. He could accuse competing  UK newspapers – including the <em>Guardian</em>, the <em>Independent</em>, the <em>Daily Mail</em>, the <em>Telegraph</em>, the <em>Mirror </em>– of cowardly silence for standing by while the government dismantled his holdings. Although the <em>Sun</em> is profitable, the <em>Sunday Times</em> and <em>Times</em> aren&#8217;t,  with Rupert subsidizing them for the benefit of readers (and himself,  of course). &#8220;Rupert Murdoch: Free Speech Martyr&#8221; may not be much of a  bumper sticker, but desperate times call for desperate measures. If  Murdoch&#8217;s newspapers really have the power to control public opinion, as  his critics say, or move it in a direction that favors him, now is the time to start propagandizing.</p>
<p><strong>The Doomsday option.</strong> Murdoch critics have long deplored his dominance of the UK newspaper market. His titles<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/murdoch-to-testify-about-his-political-influence-in-uk-move-that-could-discomfit-ruling-class/2012/04/22/gIQATgYiZT_story.html"> account</a> for a third of daily newspaper circulation and 40 percent of Sunday  circulation, usually with a side comment that Murdoch&#8217;s market dominance  argues against letting him acquire the 60.9 percent he desires. What if  Murdoch let it be known that a price would be paid if the Ofcom  regulators booted him out of BSkyB – that is, that he would depart the UK  media market completely and salt the earth behind him? He wouldn&#8217;t sell  the <em>Times</em>, the <em>Sunday Times</em> and the <em>Sun</em>; he&#8217;d just fold them as he did <em>News of the World</em>,  putting thousands of journalists, printers, salespeople and others  out of work. I can hear Murdoch&#8217;s John Galtian speech now: &#8220;If I am not  fit to own part of BSkyB, then I&#8217;m not fit to own UK newspapers, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nothing  would make the Labour Party and Murdoch&#8217;s competitors happier. And UK  newspaper profits aren&#8217;t important to News Corp.&#8217;s bottom line, so the  self-inflicted wound would not be grievous. Would Labour wake up and  realize that Murdoch is a political asset – the perfect Satan to blame for all their ills? That  if he didn&#8217;t exist, they&#8217;d have to invent him? Do they really want to  be blamed – even in part – for the loss of so many newspaper jobs in such a  short interval? Murdoch has already proved he&#8217;ll bow in the short term  to survive the long term. Could he bluff his way past the regulators and  the politicians?</p>
<p>All  of these schemes are outrageous, low-percentage gambles. But that’s the  sort of character Rupert Murdoch is. Whatever goes down, he won&#8217;t give  up. They&#8217;ll never take him alive.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A book excerpt published by New York magazine channels supposed doubts that Ben Bradlee had about aspects of the Watergate story. But on close examination, the newly aired charges are thin indeed.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/files/2012/04/bradlee.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-824" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="Bradlee, a former Washington Post executive editor and Woodward, a former Post reporter, pose for a photo during a tour of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda" src="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/files/2012/04/bradlee-300x220.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220" /></a>In 1990, former <em>Washington Post</em> Executive Editor Ben Bradlee told journalist Barbara Feinman, who was helping him on his memoir<em><a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/A_good_life.html?id=PJpZAAAAMAAJ"> A Good Life: Newspapering and Other Adventures</a></em>, that he had &#8220;a little problem with Deep Throat.&#8221; Bradlee, who was then 69 years old, continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>Did  that potted [plant] incident ever happen? … and meeting in some garage.  One meeting in the garage? Fifty meetings in the garage? I don’t know  how many meetings in the garage … There’s a residual fear in my soul  that that isn’t quite straight.</p></blockquote>
<p>This confession and other findings drawn from Ben Bradlee&#8217;s papers appear in a book<a href="http://nymag.com/print/?/news/features/ben-bradlee-2012-5/"> excerpt</a> that was published in <em>New York</em> magazine  last night. The excerpt has sparked a near riot in Watergate Nation – the  principals who reported the story, other journalists, history buffs,  and political devotees for whom the 1972 Democratic  National Committee headquarters break-in and Nixon administration cover-up remain an  inexhaustible topic of fascination.</p>
<p>The excerpted book, <em>Yours in Truth: A Personal Portrait of Ben Bradlee</em>,  which goes on sale May 8, is by former Bob Woodward researcher Jeff  Himmelman. Himmelman first surveyed the Bradlee papers as part of a  proposed book collaboration with Bradlee, but after the veteran editor  decided against writing the book, he gave Himmelman sanction to write his  own book based on the material.</p>
<p>Himmelman&#8217;s <em>New York</em> excerpt  exploits his Bradlee-in-doubt finding for maximum dramatic potential.  First, he confronts Woodward with the Bradlee quotations and recounts at  length his former boss&#8217;s reaction. (Bob is rattled.) Next, he recounts a  morning powwow at Bradlee&#8217;s house in which Bradlee, Woodward and  Himmelman discuss the merits of publishing the two-decades-old interview  about Bradlee&#8217;s Deep Throat &#8220;problem,&#8221; debating whether or not it should  be included in the Himmelman book. Naturally, Woodward is opposed,  saying it would give &#8220;fodder to the fuckers&#8221; who hate Bradlee, the <em>Washington Post</em>, the <em>Post</em>&#8216;s Watergate coverage, and Woodward.</p>
<p>With  all the grace of a toddler icing a cake with a shovel, Himmelman paints  that powwow scene in Oedipal colors. Himmelman is killing the older  Woodward who gave him a first, big break; Woodward is contemplating the  murder of his own mentor, Bradlee, who listens to all arguments but  approves the use of the interview in Himmelman&#8217;s book. I’m eager to read the book to learn if any eyes are gouged out or sacred laws of hospitality are violated.</p>
<p>The  other bomb detonated by the Himmelman excerpt accuses Woodward and Carl  Bernstein of having lied for decades about one aspect of their Watergate  reporting. The two have always maintained that the Watergate grand  jurors they approached during their reporting told them nothing (their efforts on this front earned them a verbal <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6MYYI_LNfWsC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=John+Sirica+is+some+kind+of+pissed+at+you+fellas,%E2%80%9D&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kPaeT-bkIobH6AGCqajsDg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20Sirica%20is%20some%20kind%20of%20pissed%20at%20you%20fellas%2C%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false">rebuke </a>from the court, which warned the paper not to interfere with the grand jury). But a memo found by Himmelman in Bradlee&#8217;s papers states that a grand juror code-named &#8220;Z&#8221; did speak to them. &#8220;All of the quotes attributed to Z in [<em>All the President's Men</em>]  matched this interview,&#8221; Himmelman writes. &#8220;And there was no doubt, in  the memo, how Z knew what she knew: &#8216;Of course, I was on the grand  jury,&#8217; she said plainly.&#8221;</p>
<p>When  Himmelman interviewed Woodward and Bernstein about the memo, they said  Carl hadn&#8217;t known the woman was a grand juror when he first visited her,  and Woodward told Himmelman dismissively, &#8220;This is a footnote to a  footnote.&#8221; Bernstein joked: &#8220;Maybe they&#8217;ll send us to jail after all  [for approaching the grand jury].&#8221;</p>
<p>In a written explanation Woodward and Bernstein gave to the <em>Washington Post</em>&#8216;s Joel Achenbach for<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/achenblog/post/woodward-and-bernstein-respond-to-himmelman/2012/04/30/gIQAt9irrT_blog.html"> publication</a>,  the duo reiterate in detail their denial that Bernstein knew  the woman was a grand juror when he originally went to interview her.  Woodward and Bernstein continue: &#8220;To the best of our recollection,  someone contacted Carl and said there was a person, a neighbor, who had  important information on Watergate. Carl went and interviewed the woman  as described in the Dec. 4, 1972 memo.&#8221;</p>
<p>According  to Woodward and Bernstein, Bernstein &#8220;quotes her in the memo as  volunteering, ‘of course I was on the grand jury’ because that was news  to him.&#8221; They add that they did not identify her as a grand juror in the  book to protect her as a source.</p>
<p>I asked Max Holland, author of the new book <em>Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat</em>, for his reaction to the Himmelman excerpt. He responded via email.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is getting lost in the coverage so far is that Bradlee is not expressing qualms about the Post&#8217;s reporting and/or published stories from June &#8217;72 onwards, but reservations about the fairy tale that is All the President&#8217;s Men,&#8221;  he said. It&#8217;s Holland&#8217;s view that Felt leaked to Woodward not out of  patriotism, as Woodward originally wrote, but out of self-interest. He  was<a href="http://reut.rs/zZIVBm"> jockeying</a> for the top job at the FBI.</p>
<p>Woodward and Himmelman are also dueling in the pages of Politico, where Dylan Byers is covering the story. In<a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0412/75732.html#.T54XtF-jptE.twitter"> one</a> Byers piece, Woodward accused Himmelman of not including in his <em>New York</em> excerpt  a Bradlee interview from 18 months ago in which Bradlee expressed full  confidence in Woodward&#8217;s Watergate reporting. ”He can write what he  wants, but his own transcript undercuts his premise,” Woodward told  Byers. “It’s one of those Perry Mason moments.”</p>
<p>Himmelman has<a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0412/75744.html"> returned</a> fire. He told Byers that the interview Woodward describes can be found  in his forthcoming book. Himmelman also cited a year-old interview in  which he offered Bradlee a chance to retract his 1990 doubts, and he  declined.</p>
<p>With  all respect to Ben Bradlee, the Woodward-Himmelman spat is starting to  resemble that movie in which a much-coveted dog is placed midway  between two contesting owners and they rely on him to choose which owner  he wants to go home with. Isn&#8217;t this historical dispute, which relies on  accurate memory, a bit much to put a 91-year-old man through? Bradlee  obviously admires and respects both journalists, but age has dimmed his  powers of concentration (as it has mine). For that reason, I put less  stock in what Bradlee has been telling Himmelman since 2007, when they  first started talking, than I do the original interview with Feinman  from 1990, when he had yet to<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/21/us/bradlee-will-retire-sept-1-as-editor-of-the-washington-post.html"> retire</a> as <em>Post </em>executive editor.</p>
<p>If  Bradlee had Deep Throat doubts in 1990, if he wondered about the  efficacy of the potted-plant meeting signals and the likelihood that  Woodward actually had multiple meetings with Deep Throat in a parking  garage, he is hardly alone. Those elements belong to <em>All the President&#8217;s Men</em>, a Woodward and Bernstein product over which Bradlee had no direct control, and not the <em>Washington Post</em>, over which Bradlee did. It means something that Bradlee doubts <em>All the President&#8217;s Men</em>, but what?</p>
<p>Until  the Himmelman book appears, and he shows his complete hand, I&#8217;d be nuts  to declare a winner in this dispute. But if this were a boxing match,  I&#8217;d give the first round to Woodward.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/files/2012/04/trip.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-809" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch appears before the Leveson inquiry in London" src="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/files/2012/04/trip-300x132.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="132" /></a>Pummel  Rupert Murdoch and his minions all you want for News Corp.&#8217;s  phone-hacking of celebrities and crime victims, its computer-hacking,  its blagging, its bribing of police, its payments of hush money, its  obstruction of justice, and its operation of what former British Prime  Minister Gordon Brown once <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14144968">called</a> a &#8220;criminal-media nexus.&#8221;</p>
<p>But spare me the feigned outrage excited by this week&#8217;s interrogations of Murdoch and his son James Murdoch by the<a href="http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/hearing"> Leveson</a> Inquiry into press ethics and practices. The<em><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/apr/25/jeremy-hunt-news-corp-bskyb"> Guardian</a></em>, the<em><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/leveson-inquiry/9224785/Leveson-Inquiry-I-discussed-bid-with-David-Cameron-says-James-Murdoch.html"> Telegraph</a></em> and the<em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/25/world/europe/murdoch-case-shifts-its-focus-to-jeremy-hunt.html?_r=1&amp;ref=todayspaper"> New York Times</a></em>,  among others, appear to be appalled by news that the media baron  lobbied the UK government aggressively so that he could expand his  holdings in the tightly regulated satellite broadcaster BSkyB from 39.1  percent to 100 percent. The <em>Times</em> cites subpoenaed News Corp. emails released by Leveson to show a  Murdoch lobbyist working &#8220;hand-in-glove&#8221; with the office of a government  regulator.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t  climbing into the skins of regulators the very definition of lobbying?  That&#8217;s how I understand it. Hate Murdoch all you want, but if you&#8217;re  invested in highly regulated businesses like BSkyB and you need  government approval to invest deeper in the regulated business, then  working &#8220;hand-in-glove&#8221; with the regulators is exactly what the  situation calls for. Should the Murdochs have ignored the regulators as  they attempted to increase their holdings in BSkyB? Of course not.</p>
<p>Likewise,  I fail to detect the scandal in James Murdoch meeting repeatedly with  David Cameron while Cameron was still the leader of the opposition, as  James confessed in Tuesday&#8217;s Leveson<a href="http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-24-April-2012.pdf"> grilling</a> (pdf), or of James&#8217;s admission of having raised the topic of News  Corp.&#8217;s bid for BSkyB in a &#8220;tiny, side conversation&#8221; with Cameron at a  social event in December 2010. If political judgments are being made  over who can own and operate businesses, the Murdochs would be remiss if  they hadn&#8217;t approached politicians for their support. For example,  today&#8217;s <em>Wall Street Journal</em><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303978104577364203474601114.html?mod=googlenews_wsj"> reports</a> that NetJets, the private-jet company owned by Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire  Hathaway has spent in excess of $1 million over the last three years to  lobby Congress to reduce user fees charged to his wealthy customers.  This is the same Warren Buffett behind the so-called Buffett Rule to  soak the rich.</p>
<p>If  the issue is that Rupert Murdoch is not a fit owner of BSkyB under the  law because he buys and sells politicians, that <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/08/for-rupert-murdoch-media-has-always-been-about-friends-and-influence.html">his newspapers contrive  investigations</a> to punish politicians who stand in the way of his  conquests and that his enterprises corrupt police forces, then let’s  have that debate. But that’s not the accusation against  Murdoch at the Leveson Inquiry this particular news cycle.</p>
<p>Remember,  the UK media establishment has long felt threatened by Murdoch&#8217;s daring  ways in the marketplace and has routinely urged regulators to save them  from his predations. In October 2010, executives from the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, the <em>Daily Mail</em>, the <em>Guardian</em>, the <em>Daily Mirror</em>, the BBC, Channel 4 and the BT Group<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/oct/11/murdoch-bskyb-british-media-unite"> signed</a> a letter to government regulators protesting Murdoch&#8217;s proposed BSkyB takeover. The<em> Financial Times</em>,  another Murdoch competitor, editorialized against the acquisition  because Murdoch might use his newly expanded BSkyB power to subsidize  and popularize his UK newspapers, including his<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/mar/23/news-international-times-sun"> money-losing</a> <em>Times</em> and <em>Sunday Times</em>. Oh, and they made obligatory noises about how Murdoch’s purchase would damage democracy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We  believe that the proposed takeover could have serious and far-reaching  consequences for media plurality,&#8221; the 2010 letter from the executives  lamented. As I<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/press_box/2010/10/why_the_uk_media_deserve_rupert_murdoch.html"> observed</a> at the time, this fretting about &#8220;media plurality&#8221; was a little rich  coming from a consortium of bellyachers that included the BBC, a global  enterprise that was then reaping $7.7 billion annually in  revenues compared with BSkyB&#8217;s $9.4 billion. The BBC benefits from an  arrangement in which all households that watch or record TV must  purchase a compulsory $235 &#8220;<a href="http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/easy-read/why-you-need-a-tv-licence-ea25">license</a>&#8221;  (go ahead and call it a tax if you wish, because you&#8217;ll be fined up to  $1,600 if you don&#8217;t pay) that funds the BBC. It takes some gall for the  BBC, which automatically collects money from TV households, to protest  what might happen if Murdoch gains greater control over a competing  business that people voluntarily pay for.</p>
<p>My previously mentioned 2010<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/press_box/2010/10/why_the_uk_media_deserve_rupert_murdoch.html"> piece</a> reviewed the historical heavy-handedness of UK media regulators. In  1920, when only three radio stations aired programming in the UK, the  government declined applications for new licenses,<a href="http://www.citi.columbia.edu/elinoam/articles/SPECTRM1.htm"> claiming</a> that &#8220;the ether is already full.&#8221; As Eli M. Noam reported in his 1991 book, <em>Broadcasting in Europe</em>,  UK newspaper publishers encouraged the development of the &#8220;public&#8221; BBC  so that no new commercial enterprise could take root, as happened in the  United States, and attack their advertising base. UK regulators  suppressed commercial TV and radio for decades and protected the BBC  from the onslaught of cable TV. Parliament even regulated the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/39">VCR</a>.</p>
<p>The  campaign against Murdoch&#8217;s total ownership of BSkyB is only more of the  same. UK protectionism and the state sanctioning of the BBC make Rupert  Murdoch, a villain many times over in other arenas, an unlikely hero.  Reading the latest Leveson transcripts, I have yet to find evidence of  him seeking direct favors from the government (subsidies, bailouts,  etc.), although I am made suspicious by his insistence <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17836722">today</a> that, &#8220;I have never asked a prime minister for anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>As best as I can judge, he seems to be seeking the liberty to invest his billions the way he sees fit to compete against the established interests. Don’t damn Murdoch for learning the rules of the regulatory game and then playing them as aggressively as he can.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">* * * * * *</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.slate.com/authors.jack_shafer.html">old days</a>, I tried to work into every Murdoch column a reference to his 2007 denial that he was a &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/09/AR2007080901972.html">genocidal tyrant</a>.&#8221; I tried and failed in this column.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If  you talk very long with soldiers who&#8217;ve seen combat, they&#8217;ll offer that  death is a joke. Not a very funny joke,<a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/files/2012/04/Latimes3.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-792" title="Latimes" src="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/files/2012/04/Latimes3-163x300.jpg" alt="" width="163" height="300" /></a> but one that never gets old.  With every new war, with every new brigade of recruits, soldiers  rediscover the death joke and retell it by taking battlefield trophies  of enemy equipment, enemy personal effects and even staged photos with  enemy body parts, as the <em>Los Angeles Times</em><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-afghan-photos-20120418,0,6471010,full.story"> reports</a> today.</p>
<p>The <em>Times </em>obtained  a series of 18 photos of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan posing with enemy  corpses and published two of them in a story that began on page one. The  living posers are all grins and chuckles, indicating the high mirth  that battlefield death brings. In one of the published photos, amused  U.S. soldiers hoist two severed legs of a suicide bomber and mug for the  camera.</p>
<p>The <em>Times </em>describes other photos it did not run:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two  soldiers posed holding a dead man&#8217;s hand with the middle finger raised.  A soldier leaned over the bearded corpse while clutching the man&#8217;s  hand. Someone placed an unofficial platoon patch reading &#8220;Zombie Hunter&#8221;  next to other remains and took a picture.</p></blockquote>
<p>The  publication of the photos elicited the standard response from the  Pentagon. Marine General John R. Allen, commander of Western troops in  Afghanistan,<a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/04/nato-commander-photos-troops-body-parts-afghan-bombers.html"> called</a> the photos &#8220;entirely inconsistent&#8221; with U.S. values and promised a full investigation. The Pentagon also asked the <em>Times </em>not  to publish the two-year-old images because, as its spokesman put it,  they do not &#8220;represent the character and the professionalism of the  great majority of our troops in Afghanistan&#8221; and they have &#8220;the  potential to indict them all in the minds of local Afghans, inciting  violence and perhaps causing needless casualties.&#8221; The <em>Times </em>correctly  waved away those objections, stating its duty to report &#8220;vigorously and  impartially&#8221; on the U.S. intervention, &#8220;including the allegation that  the images reflect a breakdown in unit discipline that was endangering  U.S. troops.&#8221;</p>
<p>The outrage the military is expressing over these ghoulish images ignores the fact that  the taking of battlefield trophies, photographic or otherwise, is as  old as war itself, as are military commanders&#8217; bans on the  collection of such ghoulish souvenirs, as Simon Harrison explains in his  2006 paper, &#8220;Skull Trophies of the Pacific War: Transgressive Objects  of Remembrance&#8221; (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9655.2006.00365.x/abstract">abstract</a>).  Harrison differentiates between &#8220;near enemies&#8221; and &#8220;distant enemies,&#8221;  with near enemies remaining safe from mutilation and scalp-taking  but distant enemies being fair game. During World War Two, he observes, the  Japanese were the distant enemy, and their body parts, including ears,  teeth and especially skulls, were routinely gathered as keepsakes.  Germans and Italians, the near enemy, remained largely safe from  mutilation and desecration.</p>
<p>The desecration of the bodies of Japanese soldiers was so common that in 1944, <em><a href="http://www.timelifepictures.com/source/search/details_pop.aspx?iid=50693116&amp;cdi=0">Life</a></em> magazine  published a light-headed photo of a young woman posing with a Japanese  soldier&#8217;s skull sent to her from New Guinea by her Navy boyfriend. That  same year, columnist Drew Pearson <a href="http://dspace.wrlc.org/doc/get/2041/20541/b05f17-0613zdisplay.pdf">reported</a> (pdf) that Representative Francis E. Walter  (D-Penn.) had presented President Franklin D. Roosevelt with a letter opener made from  the forearm of a Japanese soldier. &#8220;This is the sort of gift I like to  get,&#8221; Pearson quotes FDR saying, although the president did not touch  it.</p>
<p>The Japanese government made propaganda out of the two high-profile incidents, James J. Weingartner writes in a 1992<a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/c/a/caw43/behrendwriting/Weingartner,%20James%20J..pdf"> paper</a> (pdf). Both acts violated the 1929 Geneva Convention prohibition  against the mistreatment of the dead. The Navy lieutenant was  reprimanded, and FDR returned the letter opener with instructions that it  be properly buried. Although the U.S. command reiterated once more its  policy against the desecration of enemy remains, trophy-taking continued in  the Pacific Theater until war&#8217;s end. Harrison recounts the story of a  Japanese skull gathered at Guadalcanal that one Marine handed down to  the next generation. Nicknamed &#8220;Oscar&#8221; and autographed by dozens of  servicemen, the skull had been lacquered and occupied a  middle-of-the-shelf place of honor in the collector&#8217;s home. After he  died in 1960, it remained a cherished object by its inheritors for  several more decades.</p>
<p>In  making playpens of Afghan bones, U.S. soldiers signal not a breakdown  in leadership and discipline in the unit, as the soldier who gave the  photos to the newspaper would have it, but the soldiers&#8217; view that  they&#8217;re fighting a dehumanized &#8220;far enemy,&#8221; akin to the Japanese or the  Viet Cong, whose body parts were often violated by U.S. soldiers during  the Vietnam War. Harrison surmises – although not in these words – that  much of the body-part souvenir-taking that goes on during wartime displays a  coward&#8217;s courage. That is, the corpse is collected by the soldier who  discovered it, not the one who did the killing. (Evidence of decomposition and  rat-chew marks on &#8220;Oscar&#8217;s&#8221; skull indicate that it was discovered later, not  harvested from the battlefield by the killer.)</p>
<p>Harrison  allows that the fierceness of combat may cause soldiers to mutilate the  enemy and collect human souvenirs, but notes that &#8220;battlefield  conditions cannot explain why servicemen in many cases collected such  trophies not for themselves but – as is often the case with souvenirs and  holiday mementos purchased by tourists – as gifts for relatives and  others back home. Some collected such objects at the specific request of  family members.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without defending the conduct of the unit that allegedly posed for and took the disgraceful photos, we should keep in mind that the collection and preservation of enemy body parts is no longer for rogues only. Amassing the arms, legs, torsos, skulls, body scraps and full remains of dead enemies for intelligence purposes now appears to be U.S. military policy. As the <em>Times </em>explains,  the parts were set aside by Afghan police until U.S. soldiers could  visit and lift iris scans and fingerprints from them for identification.  Even dead, these combatants were worthy of a biometric interrogation in  which they were expected to provide forensic battlefield intelligence: dead, but still capable of speaking.</p>
<p>Why does the ancient art of trophy-taking tend to make its practitioners  grin or chuckle the way the soldiers captured in the photos published  in the <em>Times</em> are? They seem to be laughing at death, but I think death is laughing at them.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/files/2012/04/mole.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-777" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="mole" src="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/files/2012/04/mole-300x222.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="222" /></a>A  Fox News Channel employee has turned mole at the behest of Gawker and  has now filed two dispatches from the House that Roger Ailes Built.</p>
<p>In the first, published on<a href="http://gawker.com/5900710"> Monday</a>,  the Fox Mole describes the misery of working for the channel: He (we  don’t know for certain it’s a man, but it seems a reasonable assumption)  hoped that his Fox gig would help him find &#8220;a new job that didn&#8217;t make  me cringe every morning when I looked in the mirror.&#8221; He also leaked a  moderately amusing pre-broadcast chat between Mitt Romney and Sean  Hannity.</p>
<p>The second, published<a href="http://gawker.com/5900848/the-thin-white-line-that-separates-fox-news-staffers-from-bill-oreilly-on-the-shitter"> today</a>,  portrays the &#8220;soul-crushing&#8221; material conditions of working at Fox  News. &#8220;The basement newsroom is dreary, with no windows, fluorescent  lighting, and constant worrying about an infestation from bedbugs, mice  or some other vermin,&#8221; the Mole writes. He also complains about having  to work on ancient computers, about the poor reception that desktop TVs  receive, about malfunctioning printers and other office injustices.</p>
<p>If  this is the work of a media mole, Gawker should think about replacing  him with a hippo, which the site may have the opportunity to do soon if,  as an unnamed Fox News spokesman<a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/fox-news-spokesman-we-found-the-mole/"> told</a> Mediaite, the channel has already identified him.</p>
<p>The  problem with smoking media moles out is that they&#8217;re like  Spartacus – there&#8217;s always another wise guy willing to risk his job to  tell tales on his bosses. As one who reported on the secret doings inside other media  organizations for many years, I can tell you that finding a newsroom  asset who will spill the beans on his bosses, leak embarrassing  documents and otherwise rat his organization out is as easy as placing a phone call.</p>
<p>Journalists  don&#8217;t necessarily leak to other journalists about their workplace  because they&#8217;re inherently untrustworthy. Leaking comes naturally to  them because they spend so much time drilling for their own liquid  assets, because they&#8217;re in the information-trading racket, because they  thrill at the sight of transparency, and because they love to defy  authority, especially when the authorities are the ones who sign their  paychecks.</p>
<p>When I wrote regularly about Washington media for <em>Washington City Paper</em> back in the 1990s, I received – without asking – potentially embarrassing confidential memos from inside the <em>Washington Post</em>, the <em>Washington Times</em>,  the wire services and the TV network bureaus, as well as provocative  emails and edit trails that documented how editors had twisted a story.  One time, a Postie leaked me the 5,000-word-plus internal critique of the <em>Washington Post</em> Style section (which I published). Another time, a <em>Washington Times</em> reporter  sent me the novel-in-progress the newspaper&#8217;s executive editor was  idiotically composing on the paper&#8217;s computer system. One <em>Post</em> editor  got so peeved at the frequency with which I published memos from his  publication that he announced plans inside the paper to create  counterfeit memos to fool me. That subterfuge was compromised when a <em>Post</em> reporter leaked it to me.</p>
<p>Leaks  to alternative weeklies kept editors and producers on their toes for a  couple of decades. Then the Web happened. Or should I say <a href="http://jimromenesko.com/">Jim Romenesko</a> happened. Newsroom renegades forwarded every newsworthy interoffice  memo written by their editors to Romenesko for inclusion in his blog  with such regularity that the editors might as well have cc:ed him on  all of their correspondence.</p>
<p>Thanks  to Romenesko and other journo-leak gatherers, news organizations operate  in near-fishbowl environments. If a boss starts his chat to staff with,  &#8220;I&#8217;d better not read this in Romenesko or Gawker,&#8221; he only doubles the  chances that it will land there. The salutary effect has been a  reduction in overt boss-to-employee cruelty, but probably an increase  in covert boss-to-employee cruelty. Still, the current status quo  operates to the benefit of the staff, which can undermine  transgressing bosses with unprecedented speed and accuracy.</p>
<p>Rarely  are leaks or reports from media moles half as interesting as the  leakers or moles think they are. Morale is low inside the Daily Bugle?  A top editor is shagging an intern? Johnny Deadline is getting demoted  to obits? Who cares! Leaks matter most when wrapped inside of context or  delivered with some sort of art. The vocoder through which <em>Spy</em> magazine&#8217;s pseudonymous J.J. Hunsecker warbled about doings at the <em>New York Times</em> proved  endlessly entertaining, demystifying the stuffed-up place. (Still, I  can&#8217;t remember a single entry off the top of my head, except for  J.J.&#8217;s observation that one of the editors at the Sunday magazine had a  habit of not washing his hands after making night soil in the bathroom.)</p>
<p>Likewise, I&#8217;d have more affection for the Fox Mole if he could write more like<a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/moetkacik"> Moe Tkacik</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/pareene"> Alex Pareene</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/choire"> Choire Sicha</a> or any of the other acid pens to have scribbled under Nick Denton. Doesn’t Gawker have a rewrite desk?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s  hoping that reports of the Fox Mole&#8217;s capture are exaggerated and that  he&#8217;ll start filing dispatches that tell us more about the editorial  practices at Fox News and less about the condition of Fox News bathrooms  (unless he catches somebody coming out of one without washing his hands).  The toughest part of serving as the Fox News Mole is this: Practically  nothing he overhears in the newsroom, pinches from the email threads or  purloins from the video stream can be half as outrageous as what Fox  News broadcasts every day.</p>
<p><em><strong>Addendum, April 12, 9 a.m.: </strong></em>The Fox Mole has been flushed. David Carr&#8217;s <a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/12/fox-quickly-hunts-down-mole-my-that-didnt-take-long/">take</a>.</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>The  Reuters Mole in the Washington, D.C., bureau – me – has these complaints:  No Caller ID on the phones, and Windows XP, a 10-year-old operating  system, on all of the computers. The bathrooms are all right. Send your leaks  to Shafer.Reuters@gmail.com and watch my <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/jackshafer">Twitter</a> feed for confidential drizzles.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/files/2012/04/insta.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-768" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="A photo illustration shows the applications Facebook and Instagram on the screen of an iPhone in Zagreb" src="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/files/2012/04/insta-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>Today, Facebook<a href="../../breakingviews/2012/04/09/facebooks-defensive-instagram-ma-raises-red-flag/"> purchased</a> Instagram – maker of the wildly popular iPhone and Android photo-sharing  app of the same name – for $1 billion. That&#8217;s a lot of money for a  company that&#8217;s less than two years old and has no real revenues. But  viewed historically the deal is a smart one. Facebook founder Mark  Zuckerberg is onto something. The human desire for self-expression – to  say something as simple as &#8220;I&#8217;m here&#8221; – is insatiable, and Instagram  exploits it superbly.</p>
<p>Sometimes  the simpler the message, the more urgent the need to share it. Example:  The first thing most people do upon landing at an airport and being  told by the captain they can now use their mobile phones is to whip it  out and tell someone – anyone! – where they are and where they&#8217;re going.</p>
<p>In  buying Instagram, Zuckerberg acknowledges that his company&#8217;s own mobile  app is an inconvenient, ineffective way to say &#8220;I&#8217;m here.&#8221; Using  Instagram to transmit pictures of San Francisco, shots of the ballpark  or plates full of food to other smartphones lets users convey their  here-ness in greater detail and precision than the overcooked stew that  the Facebook platform allows. And there is no learning curve: All you  need to make an Instagrammatic statement is 1) a mobile device with a  camera, 2) an itchy trigger finger and 3) an Instagram account.</p>
<p>Instagram  marks the latest point on a communications timeline that starts with  the telephone&#8217;s invention in the mid-1800s. As Paul Starr writes in <em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=KO30kMoLKKkC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=%22originated+in+an+effort+to+improve+and+extend+the+telegraph,+not+to+replace+it.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yRk-NQ1doh&amp;sig=O3wQDlMM63FJeKZ6NDjre4zI6Ms&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MFaDT8bIE4iA2gWH1uGGCA&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22originated%20in%20an%20effort%20to%20improve%20and%20extend%20the%20telegraph%2C%20not%20to%20replace%20it.%22&amp;f=false">The Creation of the Media</a></em> (2004),  &#8220;the telephone originated in an effort to improve and extend the  telegraph, not to replace it.&#8221; None of the early telephone visionaries  of the day imagined that nearly every household would subscribe to  telephone service and place calls to other subscribers for personal  chats. It was a commercial device, too expensive to be wasted on  self-expression. Only as costs fell did the telephone stop being a  business luxury and become a shared family essential over which  everything from grocery orders to courtship was transmitted.</p>
<p>Telephone reigned as the supreme communications device until the early 1990s, when<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pager"> pagers</a> (those now mostly forgotten texting machines), fax machines and email  began to undermine it. Email might have supplanted the telephone even  faster if the first big online companies – CompuServe, Delphi, Prodigy  and the rest – had given email greater primacy. That innovation came from  the upstarts at America Online, who understood that what people wanted  most from the online experience was not a new version of the SkyMall or  back issues of <em>PC Magazine</em> or an online weather report, but a  simple user interface that facilitated self-expression in chat rooms  and email. AOL&#8217;s email victory was temporary, however, as the universal  Internet became ubiquitous. Email over the Internet worked so well that  telephones around the world stopped ringing!</p>
<p>The  victory of email text over voice was short-lived. Soon, mobile phones  returned voice to first place, but not for long. Fingers flying  across telephone keypads returned text to the top of the communications  heap, which is where we stand today. Or at least as of yesterday, as our  progression from voice (via telephone) to text (via email) to voice  (via mobile phone) and back to text again has been interrupted by  Instagram&#8217;s pictures. These pictures take us to a post-verbal,  post-textual place that cries out for Marshall McLuhan to interpret. Oh,  sure, you can add words and even &#8220;likes&#8221; to an Instagram, but why  bother? It&#8217;s like using a phone to send Morse code.</p>
<p>So, Instagram is here. What I want to know is: Where is it going to take us?</p>
