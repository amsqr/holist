		<description><![CDATA[<p>Greece vs Facebook.</p>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/files/2012/05/economist-cover-the-greek-run2.jpg" alt="economist-cover-the-greek-run2.jpg" width="300" height="396" /> <img src="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/files/2012/05/fb.jpg" alt="fb.jpg" width="300" height="400" /></p>
<p>You might have <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/05/16/counterparties-are-you-sick-of-facebook-yet/">heard</a> that Facebook&#8217;s going public; certainly the editors of Businessweek have, and so they&#8217;ve managed to come up with a <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-05-17/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-the-valley">listicle</a> (&#8220;five hacks that have changed Silicon Valley forever&#8221;) to put on their cover this week. The Economist, by contrast, not only has a much better cover; it has also gone with the much more important story. (Which doesn&#8217;t yet appear to be online.)</p>
<p>Watching the two stories play out in the news media, especially here in the US, has been fascinating. And it&#8217;s no coincidence that the London-based publication went with Greece while the New York-based publication went with Facebook. Looked at from New York, the Greece story is a horribly complex mess of players and parties and agendas, with no obvious timetable and no chief protagonist. Plus, while it&#8217;s clearly important from a global perspective, it&#8217;s perennially impossible to come up with any really good explanation of why a US audience should really care.</p>
<p>On the other side, looked at from across the pond, the Facebook IPO seems like much ado over relatively little: a hot company is managing to raise a large amount of equity at a high valuation. That&#8217;s fine &#8212; but in this case there&#8217;s <em>really</em> no reason why the average European should care: Facebook is not going to visibly change at all for having gone public, and Europeans in general don&#8217;t pay nearly as much attention to individual share prices as Americans do.</p>
<p>My guess is that this dynamic is going to stay in place even after Facebook has gone public and the share price has settled down: the European media will cover the Greece story in minute detail, while the US media will largely ignore it, but for the occasional dull-and-worthy piece buried where no one will find it, until such time as it starts causing visible repercussions for US banks or stocks.</p>
<p>For a world which supposedly globalized decades ago, the crucial and central importance of the Greece story to Europe, and its decidedly peripheral status in the US, is telling. If you were launching a new <a href="http://qz.com/">publication</a> aimed at the &#8220;global business elite&#8221; right now, which of these stories would you consider more important? You&#8217;d try to cover them both, of course. But if you spent too much time on Facebook, your non-US audience would consider you frivolous, and if you spent too much time on Greece, your US audience (and, crucially, your US advertisers) would consider you wonky and worthy and boring. Maybe the answer is to just stick with shiny photos of a major global city at night. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/04/27/portfolio-magazine-gets-liquidated-there-goes-100-million/">That always works</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160;&#160;Iksil's now learned a $2 billion lesson -- and as Boaz Weinstein can attest, once learned, those lessons can be surprisingly valuable.</p>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In February 2009, Deutsche Bank <a href="https://www.db.com/ir/en/content/ir_releases_2009_7249.htm">announced</a> that its Credit Trading desk had managed to lose €3.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008, with €1 billion of those losses directly attributable to the bank&#8217;s prop desk.</p>
<blockquote><p>The losses in the Credit Proprietary Trading business were mainly driven by losses on long positions in the U.S. Automotive sector and by falling corporate and convertible bond prices and basis widening versus the Credit Default Swaps (CDS) established to hedge them.</p></blockquote>
<p>In English, Deutsche Bank had put on a basis trade: it owned credit instruments, like bonds, and it also owned credit default swaps designed to hedge against those loans. And then the trade blew up.</p>
<p>The Deutsche trader responsible for the monster losses was Boaz Weinstein, who eventually <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aT0Iz2pefNz4&amp;refer=home">left the bank</a> to start his own hedge fund, Saba Capital. His first job, obviously, was to make sure he didn&#8217;t blow up a second time. But his second job, it seems, was to use his experience at Deutsche to be able to notice when someone <em>else</em> was about to blow up on a massive basis trade. In this case, JP Morgan.</p>
<p>Go back to early February, long before the articles about the &#8220;London Whale&#8221; came out in <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-05/jpmorgan-trader-iksil-s-heft-is-said-to-distort-credit-indexes.html">Bloomberg</a> and the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303299604577326031119412436.html?mod=wsj_share_tweet">WSJ</a>, and you&#8217;ll find Weinstein revealing <a href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-02-03/wall_street/31020146_1_trade-idea-share-ideas-credit-trading">his biggest trade</a> at the Harbor Investment Conference:</p>
<blockquote><p>The derivatives trader and legendary hedge fund manager said his trade idea is to buy Investment Grade Series 9 10-Year Index CDS (maturing on 12/20/2017).</p>
<p>&#8220;They are very attractive,&#8221; he explained adding that they can be bought at a &#8220;very good discount.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time, Weinstein didn&#8217;t know &#8212; or necessarily even suspect &#8212; that his big trade would involve a zero-sum bet with one of the biggest hedge funds in the world, JP Morgan&#8217;s Chief Investment Office. But over time, as he bought more and more protection but the price stubbornly refused to rise, he began to learn just how big the other size of the trade was. Whale big.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/6197eb2a-9f64-11e1-8b84-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1uqpupm00">Tracy Alloway and Sam Jones</a> have pieced together the best account yet of what exactly JP Morgan was up to. Yet again, it was a basis trade, although this one was horribly complex even by basis-trade standards. Essentially, that CDX.NA.IG.9 position was a second-order hedge, designed to offset volatility in JP Morgan&#8217;s first-order hedge, which was designed to offset credit risk in the rest of the bank&#8217;s portfolio.</p>
<p>The first-order hedge itself doesn&#8217;t make a great deal of sense &#8212; Iksil seems to have bought &#8220;tranches&#8221; of CDS indices, which would pay off if some (but not all) credits suddenly got into trouble. For a bank which had broad economic exposure to European meltdown and/or a US double dip, that seems like a pretty narrow hedge.</p>
<p>But if the first-order hedge is weird, the second-order hedge is downright scary. Do you remember the notorious <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2010/04/09/the-magnetar-trade/">Howie Hubler trade</a> at Morgan Stanley, where he made a smart bet against dangerous subprime securities, but then put on a much larger &#8220;hedge&#8221; which ended up costing him $9 billion? Iksil&#8217;s trade seems a bit like that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Because of the mechanics of the trade, in order to achieve a “market neutral” position, whereby JPMorgan hedged the bet against volatility as best it could and offset the cost of its short positions, the bank had to sell far more units of cheap protection on the IG.9 as a whole than it bought on short, more expensive tranches.</p></blockquote>
<p>Inevitably things started to go wrong. There are two things you can do when something starts to go wrong in the markets. You can unwind your position at a loss. Or you can try to fix it. Iksil, and Drew, chose the latter:</p>
<blockquote><p>The two legs of JPMorgan’s trade did not move according to the relationship the bank had expected, meaning the position became imperfectly hedged. Like many credit models before it, JPMorgan appeared to misjudge correlation – one of the hardest market phenomena to accurately capture in mathematics.</p>
<p>In order to try and stay risk neutral, the dynamic hedge required even more long protection to be sold. The bank continued to write swaps on the IG.9, causing a pricing distortion that was spotted by more and more hedge funds seeking profit.</p></blockquote>
<p>The rest, pretty much, is history.</p>
<p>Iksil, we&#8217;re told, is going to <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/05/16/london-whale-said-to-leave-jpmorgan/">leave JP Morgan</a>, while taking his own sweet time doing so: &#8220;although a spokeswoman for the bank said Mr. Iksil is still employed, he is no longer trading on behalf on the bank and is expected to be gone by the end of the year&#8221;. I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll use the intervening months to feel out his chances of being able to raise a few billion dollars for a hedge fund of his own, and weigh them up against simply joining a fund like Saba. Iksil&#8217;s now learned a $2 billion lesson &#8212; and as Boaz Weinstein can attest, once learned, those lessons can be surprisingly valuable.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><object width="560" height="315"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/VOAztkBDbyg?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/VOAztkBDbyg?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always"></embed></object></p>
<p>You want <a href="http://www.ifre.com/jp-morgan-investment-unit-played-by-different-high-risk-rules/21018207.article">proof</a> that JP Morgan was &#8212; <em>is</em> &#8212; using its Chief Investment Office to gamble with taxpayer-backstopped funds?</p>
<blockquote><p>The CIO unit also had a lower cost of capital than other parts of the bank, an artificial advantage that gave it an incentive to take more risk and behave in a less disciplined way, people familiar with the unit said.</p>
<p>“It was very large, but was never very transparent, and it wasn’t clear that they had an appropriate funding cost,” said the source with direct knowledge of the CIO.</p></blockquote>
<p>In any unit of any bank, one of the key drivers of profit and loss is the internal cost of funds. If you&#8217;re paying 1% for your funds and earning 3%, then you can claim profits of the difference, 2%. But if your cost of funds is increased to 2%, then your profit is halved at a stroke. For someone like Ina Drew, who was charged with turning hedges into profitable trades, the easiest way to do that would always have been to simply get Jamie Dimon to decrease the CIO&#8217;s cost of funds.</p>
<p>And at JP Morgan, just like at any other bank, the cheapest cost of funds is always deposits. JP Morgan has hundreds of billions of dollars in excess deposits just because it&#8217;s too big to fail, and has an implicit government backstop. It&#8217;s bonkers that it should then be able to take the resulting ultra-low cost of funds, and turn it into eight-figure bonuses to people like Drew, all for taking that money and playing on derivatives indices in London.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.euromoney.com/Article/3024619/Inside-JPMorgans-2-billion-loss-making-CIO-division.html?LS=EMS652612&amp;single=true">John Macaskill</a> points out, the CIO, by its own faulty measurements, had for the past two quarters more money at risk than JP Morgan&#8217;s entire investment bank &#8212; and that was with a more lenient risk measurement and with a lower cost of capital. In reality, the CIO&#8217;s risk levels were vastly greater than those at the investment bank, as we discovered after the blow-up.</p>
<p>If JP Morgan wants the CIO to be taking that kind of risk, it has to significantly increase the CIO&#8217;s internal cost of funds. The CIO is at heart a hedge fund (it&#8217;s designed to put on hedges), and JP Morgan should extend it billions on the same kind of terms that it would extend money to top prime-brokerage clients. The CIO&#8217;s secret weapon, all these years, has been its artificially low cost of funds. If that number were more realistic, maybe JP Morgan wouldn&#8217;t have ended up parking such an insanely enormous amount of money there.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Expect to see deposits continue to leave Greece -- and the rest of the European periphery as well.</p>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The size of the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/16/us-eurozone-idUSBRE84E1EI20120516">run</a> on Greek banks is not at all clear: while it seems that something on the order of €1 billion has left the banks of late, it&#8217;s less obvious whether that was over the course of one day, three days, or two weeks. The big picture, though, is unambiguous:</p>
<p><img src="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/files/2012/05/IVjhsG.jpg" alt="IVjhsG.jpg" width="620" height="347" /></p>
<p>What you&#8217;re seeing here is Greece down to its last €165 billion or so in deposits, and at the margin the rate of decrease is probably accelerating, despite the fact that most sensible Greeks will have already stashed their hard-earned euros safely outside the country a long time ago. I don&#8217;t know what the minimum amount is that Greeks need on deposit just to serve their near-term liquidity requirements, but we&#8217;re not there yet: Greece&#8217;s total population is only 11 million. So there&#8217;s a long way further this number can fall &#8212; especially since the Greek banking system <a href="https://mninews.deutsche-boerse.com/mni/mainwirex_description.jsp?serverKey=1337168454312&amp;sessionId=F9108EBF-62F8-B39E-0FBA-BEC9C9813CF9&amp;un=jduffy@marketnews.com&amp;sid=1">isn&#8217;t receiving</a> the support it needs from the ECB.</p>
<p>The more realistic constraint is simply that many Greeks lack the education and sophistication and language skills needed to move their money out of the country. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/16/us-greece-idUSBRE84D07X20120516">This</a>, for instance, is telling:</p>
<blockquote><p>A 60-year-old textiles store owner who gave his name only as Nasos said he had transferred 10,000 euros over the phone to a bank in fellow euro zone state Cyprus on Tuesday afternoon.</p></blockquote>
<p>If Greece exits the euro, there&#8217;s no doubt that there will be a massive banking crisis in Cyprus &#8212; it&#8217;s pretty much the least safe haven conceivable for someone looking to move their money from Greece. The only reason to move money to Cyprus rather than, say, Luxembourg is that they speak Greek there, and the logistics of moving money to Cyprus are easier than the logistics of moving money to any other country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the rest of the eurozone periphery, foreigners are already <a href="http://www.forexlive.com/blog/2012/05/16/foreigners-pulling-money-out-of-italian-banks/">pulling</a> their deposits from Italian banks, while the Spanish banking system is only getting increasingly precarious:</p>
<p><img src="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/files/2012/05/JNGKLL.jpg" alt="JNGKLL.jpg" width="498" height="406" /></p>
<p>All of which is to say that the causal relationship between sovereign crises and banking crises is rather more complicated than one causing the other: in reality, they cause each other, in a vicious cycle which clearly isn&#8217;t close to being broken in any of the southern European states. Greece is further along in the cycle than Spain or Portugal or Italy, but they&#8217;re all still moving in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Greece&#8217;s banks, <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/05/14/how-europe-can-force-greece-to-exit-the-euro/">remember</a>, are the mechanism by which the rest of Europe will force Grexit. Banks are the circulatory system of any economy: if they stop pumping money, the country dies. And so, <em>in extremis</em>, Greece will need to do a complete blood transfusion, replacing all euros with drachmas, if the only alternative is to see the flow of euros dry up entirely.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, expect to see deposits continue to leave Greece &#8212; and the rest of the European periphery as well. Even if your euros are reasonably safe in a big Italian bank, they&#8217;re surely safer in a big German bank. And the first thing that all depositors want is safety. Now that questions have been raised about the solvency of various southern European banking systems, it&#8217;s going to be very hard to reconstitute the eurozone in a robust fashion. The Eurozone was never designed to cope with millions of Spaniards moving their money out of the country, behaving like middle-class Venezuelans with offshore accounts in Miami. And it also was never designed to cope with capital controls. But increasingly, it looks like we&#8217;re going to end up with one or the other. Or both.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Facebook IPO is now set to raise an absolutely astonishing amount of money &#8212; as much as <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/05/16/facebook-increases-number-of-shares-for-i-p-o/?nl=business&amp;emc=edit_dlbkam_20120516">$18 billion</a>, if the greenshoe is exercised and the offering prices at the top of the indicated range. As a result, it&#8217;s certain to be the single largest technology IPO of all time. (Most companies don&#8217;t even have a valuation of $18 billion when they IPO, let alone have $18 billion worth of stock for sale to the public.)</p>
<p>So what is Facebook going to do with all that money? Well, it turns out that in upsizing the size of the IPO, Facebook has not actually increased the number of shares it&#8217;s selling to the public. Instead, most of the new shares being sold are coming from Mark Zuckerberg <del>personally</del>. He&#8217;s now going to sell 126 million shares in the IPO, and other early investors, including James Breyer and Peter Thiel, are <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303448404577407774136362662.html?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTTopStories">cashing out</a> too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll do the math for you: 126 million shares, at $38 a piece, comes to almost $5 billion. That&#8217;s a <em>lot</em> of money to raise in one day. When Facebook first filed for an IPO, Zuckerberg was only selling enough shares to allow him to pay what will probably be the single largest individual <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/02/07/technology/zuckerberg_tax_bill/index.htm">tax bill</a> the IRS has ever seen. <del>But now, Zuckerberg&#8217;s going to be a billionaire <em>excluding</em> his Facebook stake.</del>*</p>
<p>More generally, this seems to be the point at which <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2012/05/16/facebook-increases-ipo-size-again/?iid=HP_LN">the smart money is getting out</a> of Facebook. Accel Partners is now selling 49 million shares in the IPO (think $1.8 billion), while DST and Mail.Ru will sell some $2.5 billion of stock in total.</p>
<p>Capital markets are not particularly efficient, but one thing nearly always holds true: when stock prices are high, companies issue more stock, and when stock prices are low, they issue less stock. In general, we&#8217;re not seeing a huge number of primary or secondary offerings right now: it&#8217;s still cheaper for companies to issue debt rather than equity. The exception, of course, is in technology companies, where it&#8217;s clearly possible to go public at frothy multiples &#8212; even if those IPO valuations don&#8217;t last long.</p>
<p>The Facebook strategy is an interesting one: a lot of the time, in technology IPOs, you see companies issuing a pretty tiny number of shares, and using artificial scarcity to boost the price. That&#8217;s definitely not happening here &#8212; Facebook stock is going to be a highly-liquid price discovery tool from day one. And if there are lots of institutional investors out there wanting to own a piece of Facebook at a $100 billion valuation, then frankly you can&#8217;t blame Zuckerberg and Accel and DST for taking them up on their offer.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s worth remembering, here, that the main reason that Facebook is going public at all is that it has more than 500 shareholders &#8212; and the reason it has more than 500 shareholders is because early investors, including Accel and DST, have been selling down their stakes in private markets for some years now. The main difference between the public markets and the private markets is not the valuations available &#8212; $100 billion is very much in line with where Facebook stock has been trading privately &#8212; but rather in the sheer volume of stock that can be efficiently sold at one time.</p>
<p>When this IPO is over, Zuckerberg will still have complete control over the company, with more than 50% of the voting rights. But his new shareholders will look very different from his old shareholders, even if the board remains the same. And by far the biggest difference is that while the old shareholders were all sitting on monster paper profits, on their Facebook stock, the new shareholders won&#8217;t be. They&#8217;re going to want to see the share price &#8212; and Facebook&#8217;s valuation &#8212; go up, substantially. Which means that they&#8217;re going to want Zuckerberg to come up with a plan to make Facebook worth $200 billion, or $300 billion, or more.</p>
<p>In order to do that, it&#8217;s not going to be enough for Zuckerberg to build a platform: he&#8217;s going to have to monetize it, to the tune of way more than a billion dollars a year in advertising profits. Facebook, right now, is trading on its <em>potential</em> for making future profits. At some point, and it&#8217;s not all that far away, Zuckerberg&#8217;s going to have to realize that potential. Or face some extremely angry shareholders asking whether he played them for suckers when he sold those 126 million shares.</p>
<p>*<strong><em>Update</em></strong>: It now seems that the extra shares being sold by Mark Zuckerberg are <em>not</em> shares he owns, but rather <a href="http://www.ifre.com/equities-facebook-expands-ipo-to-us$16bn/21018234.article">shares he doesn&#8217;t own</a>. Zuckerberg has an &#8220;irrevocable proxy&#8221; over certain shares, which means that he controls them without owning them. He seems to be selling those shares, not shares he owns pesrsonally. So he won&#8217;t personally receive the extra billions.</p>

<p>At a time when it&#8217;s facing an ultimatum from Europe, Greece has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/15/us-greece-idUSBRE84D07X20120515">given up</a> its &#8220;nine-day hunt for a government.&#8221; New elections are on the way in June, and Greece&#8217;s anti-austerity left is expected to win.</p>
<p>For now, Greece&#8217;s lame-duck transition government can&#8217;t respond to <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2012/05/euro-crisis-0">Germany&#8217;s open threats</a> to accept crippling budget cuts or leave the euro zone. This is happening as Greece&#8217;s deputy prime minister <a href="http://telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/9262068/Greece-will-run-out-of-money-soon-warns-deputy-prime-minister.html">is warning</a> that his country could run out money in six weeks, the Greek stock market <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-the-greek-stock-market-2012-5">fell 4.5%</a> in seconds – and have we mentioned a Greek leader is <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/9265930/Merkel-tells-Greece-to-back-cuts-or-face-euro-exit.html">now warning</a> about civil war?</p>
<p>Quite suddenly, we&#8217;re back to last <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/07/21/greece-defaults/">summer</a>: pondering the implications of (another) Greek default and dealing with (another) potential <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/05/boehner-debt-limit-default-peterson-geithner.php">debt-ceiling standoff</a> in America.</p>
<p>This time, in Europe at least, is actually a bit different. After days of speculation about euro officials pondering a Grexit, IMF chief <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20120515-greece-orderly-exit-eurozone-imf-chief-tells-france-24-christine-lagarde">Christine Lagarde</a> admitted that an &#8220;orderly&#8221; Greek exit from the euro zone is a  possibility. &#8220;It is something that would be extremely expensive and  would pose great  risks but it is part of options that we must  technically consider,&#8221; she told France24. (Lagarde left the door open to  examining &#8220;the details&#8221; of Greece&#8217;s bailout program.)</p>
<p>There are also some very specific ideas of the costs involved if Greece  exits the euro. Losses for French banks could reach $25 billion; German  banks could see a $6 billion loss, according to one <a href="http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2012/05/15/1000891/your-handy-one-table-guide-to-the-cost-of-grexit/">estimate</a>. <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/jpmorgan-estimates-immediate-losses-greek-exit-could-reach-400-billion">JPMorgan </a>estimates the immediate costs for Europe could be $513 billion. <a href="http://bruxelles.blogs.liberation.fr/UBS%20fin%20de%20l%27euro.pdf">UBS figures</a> that leaving the euro zone could cost a country like Greece $12,000 to $14,000 per citizen and lead to a 50% drop in its volume of trade.</p>
<p>Much harder to tabulate is the longer-term domino effect a Grexit could have. <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2012/05/what-happens-if-greece-leaves/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheBigPicture+%28The+Big+Picture%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">James Bianco</a>,  building on Paul Krugman&#8217;s reasoning, pictures a bleak scenario:  freaked-out bank depositors moving their money from Greece, then from  Spain and Italy, raising these countries&#8217; borrowing costs and  necessitating more bailouts.</p>
<p>All of which makes it somehow fitting that new French President François Hollande&#8217;s plane was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18078845">struck by lightning</a> today. Hollande was on his way to discuss Europe&#8217;s economic governance  with Germany&#8217;s Angela Merkel; he&#8217;d just been sworn into office. – Ryan McCarthy</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I wrote about <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/05/07/new-yorks-expensive-bikeshare/">New York&#8217;s expensive bikeshare</a> scheme last week, I got a lot of pushback from people saying that I was missing the point. These bikes are designed for short trips around town, at a marginal price of zero: the large sums you pay if you keep them checked out for an hour or more are a deliberate attempt to discourage that behavior.</p>
<p>OK, fair enough &#8212; but in that case, if you&#8217;re charging high variable costs, the converse should be that you should charge low fixed costs. Most bike schemes work in much the same way: you pay a certain amount up front for membership, be it for a day or a week or a month or a year, and then the variable per-hour costs on top of that. If New York&#8217;s bikeshare scheme is indeed quite cheap, then one would expect the variable costs to be low.</p>
<p>But they&#8217;re not.</p>
<p>Ben Walsh put together some numbers for me, for various cities around the world with bikeshare schemes. Not all cities work in exactly the same way, and some have no direct comparison points with New York at all: in Chicago, for instance, the membership options are 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months. In any case, here&#8217;s what we managed to find, for New York&#8217;s three options:</p>

<p>It&#8217;s pretty clear that New York is at the top end of the range, here: only Frankfurt rivals it in price. To have access to New York&#8217;s bikes for one day, you need to spend $9.95 &#8212; that&#8217;s more than <em>six times</em> the £1 one-day membership in London, and it&#8217;s significantly more, too, than you&#8217;d pay in Washington or Toronto or Paris.</p>
<p>The first reaction of New Yorkers, when they hear this, is surprisingly positive: they think of it as a tax on tourists, and everybody likes taxes on tourists. Let the tourists pay through the nose for their one-day memberships, and we locals will save loads of money, through an implicit cross-subsidy, on our one-year memberships.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case, either. Look at the cost of one-year memberships, and New York is still top of the league table, at $95. That&#8217;s the same as Toronto, and more than seven times what Romans pay. (Indeed, the one-time membership fee in Rome, at €10, is barely more than a daily membership in New York.)</p>
<p>New Yorkers, then, are being asked to spend much more money per year than bikeshare users in just about any other major city &#8212; even if they never take out a bike for more than 45 minutes. And what worries me is the deterrent effect that these prices will have.</p>
<p>The first trip you take, on one of the new New York bikes, will cost you at <em>least</em> $10, and possibly as much as $95. Cab rides don&#8217;t cost much more than that, and you can fit four people in a cab. Experienced urban cyclists like me will definitely cough up the $95, even if that hurts a little, because we know how convenient it can be to be able to take one-way bike trips in Manhattan, especially if it&#8217;s going to rain later, or if you don&#8217;t like biking back in the dark, or if you got in to work on the subway but then just need to go a mile or so to your lunch meeting.</p>
<p>But the great promise of the bikeshare scheme is that it will get people onto bikes who have never biked before &#8212; people who are generally very nervous about biking at all on busy urban streets. Those people are going to want to try before they buy, and the $10 cost of a trial one-day membership is high enough to give them a good excuse not to bother.</p>
<p>The East River Ferry is a great example of the benefits of low entry costs and the opportunity the city&#8217;s bikeshare program is missing. When the ferry was reintroduced last June, it was free for the first 12 days. Passengers flocked and even once full fares kicked in, it remained far more popular than planners <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/17/nyregion/east-river-ferry-service-exceeds-expectations.html">projected</a>.</p>
<p>That said, from a user&#8217;s perspective there are two costs worth considering before you opt into one of these schemes, and the dollar cost is only one of them. The other one is convenience &#8212; and on that front, New York&#8217;s 10,000 bikes look as though they&#8217;re going to be <a href="http://a841-tfpweb.nyc.gov/bikeshare/station-map/">everywhere you might want one</a>, so long as you stay south of 60th Street; there are even a few docking stations in Queens! In that respect, getting on a bike is (fingers crossed) going to be much easier in New York than in most other cities &#8212; and I can definitely see how that convenience might be worth paying for.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think the pricing for these bikes is going to cause the plan to fail: New Yorkers are used to paying lots of money for convenience. I just wish there were some cheaper way of getting New Yorkers to try these things out. Because $95 is enough money &#8212; roughly the same as an unlimited monthly transit pass &#8212; that a lot of people will simply not bother.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's a quick, unscientific poll.</p>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m well aware that I live in something of a bubble, here in Manhattan: the people I hang out with tend to be college-educated white liberals, and I&#8217;m racking my brain trying to think of someone I spend any real time with who might object to gay marriage. So clearly I don&#8217;t live in anything approaching a representative sample of Americans. But still, I&#8217;m confused by the endless parade of stories about people who want to buy Facebook shares, and whether it&#8217;s a good idea to buy Facebook shares, and how to buy Facebook shares, and so on and so forth. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304543904577395122935463642.html">A classic example</a>, running at 2,300 words, is in the WSJ today:</p>
<blockquote><p>Late Monday, the social network raised the price range for its IPO to $34 to $38 a share&#8230;</p>
<p>Those numbers have created high hopes for both individual and professional investors. The excitement has drawn in fledgling stock buyers such as 11-year-old Jade Supple of Rockville Centre, N.Y., whose father plans to bet money saved to put his daughter through college on Facebook shares, although he has doubts about the price.</p></blockquote>
<p>My gut feeling, here, is that what we&#8217;re seeing is nine parts lazy editors commissioning these pieces on autopilot, to one part a real-world phenomenon of huge retail demand for Facebook stock. The press <em>loves</em> IPOs, because they&#8217;re one of the few occasions when the stock market delivers a significant news event which can be prepared for in advance. But the public? The whole investing-in-IPOs thing just feels so late-90s to me, and the performance of stocks like Groupon and Pandora is hardly likely to spark another feeding frenzy.</p>
<p>So when Henry Blodget describes the Facebook IPO as <a href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-05-10/news/31648770_1_mark-zuckerberg-facebook-cnbc">muppet bait</a>, I do wonder who the muppets really are. Is it a genuine horde of individual investors, all clamoring to get in on the hot new stock offering of the decade? Or is it the muppets on CNBC, following Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s every move like he&#8217;s the Pied Piper of Hamelin, only with a hoodie instead of a magic pipe?</p>
<p>Still, I might be wrong on this. So here&#8217;s a quick, unscientific poll. Or, just have at it in the comments.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, the <em>NYT </em>had <a href="http://links.in.reuters.com/r/LHAKU/D5/ZCSK/W1/YBJKRG/I9/h" target="_blank">a great, in-depth look</a> at soaring student debt figures, and the picture is not pretty: over the last decade, tuition and fees at state schools have increased 72%, and public funding per pupil has dropped 24%.</p>
<p>Student loans are now a generational rite of passage – 94% of students borrow to earn a bachelor&#8217;s degree, up from 43% in 1993. The total value of student loan debt has passed $1 trillion, up from $852 billion halfway through 2011. As the Federal Reserve <a href="http://links.in.reuters.com/r/LHAKU/D5/ZCSK/W1/GDVH2I/I9/h" target="_blank">shows</a>, it&#8217;s not just the young who bear the burden: a third of the value of outstanding student loans is owed by those older than 40.</p>
<p>Congress, for its part, is <a href="http://links.in.reuters.com/r/LHAKU/D5/ZCSK/W1/XHSXJ8/I9/h" target="_blank">currently wrangling</a> over a bill that would prevent federally subsidized student loan rates from doubling to 6.8% beginning July 1. Looking at that debate, Will Wilkinson <a href="http://links.in.reuters.com/r/LHAKU/D5/ZCSK/W1/EX0LCI/I9/h" target="_blank">makes</a> the point that interest rate subsidies are just another form of spending that could be better directed at scholarships for students of modest means. And Conor Friedersdorf <a href="http://links.in.reuters.com/r/LHAKU/D5/ZCSK/W1/AMG38K/I9/h" target="_blank">takes</a> that argument one step further, calling indebted college graduates a &#8220;privileged class&#8221; on whom spending money &#8220;in a country with impoverished immigrants and struggling high school dropouts and hard-pressed single mothers&#8221; is pandering at its worst.</p>
<p>While lower interest rates would help, <a href="http://links.in.reuters.com/r/LHAKU/D5/ZCSK/W1/R3DZYH/I9/h" target="_blank">Mark Kantrowitz and Mark Schneider</a> point to students&#8217; bleak income prospects: &#8220;Debt is a problem only if students don’t graduate or if graduates can’t get jobs that pay enough to allow them to repay their loans. Taking on $25,000 in student loans to earn an additional $25,000 per year is a good investment; borrowing $100,000 to earn an additional $5,000 per year is not.&#8221; Josh Barro also <a href="http://links.in.reuters.com/r/LHAKU/D5/ZCSK/W1/YBJKRV/I9/h" target="_blank">notes</a> that loans are just one way to fund higher education – direct state funding of public universities is the most obvious alternative.</p>
<p>Absent increased direct state funding, Mike Konzcal <a href="http://links.in.reuters.com/r/LHAKU/D5/ZCSK/W1/ORWVXT/I9/h" target="_blank">thinks</a> that when the government acts as a lender to students, it should lend as cheaply as it can while still making  a profit – which it&#8217;s doing at the moment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth wondering if the flood of student loans has made a college education more expensive. Without allowing students to take on unrealistic loads of debt, it&#8217;s hard to imagine college presidents saying, as Ohio State&#8217;s did to the <em>NYT: </em>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think a lot about costs.&#8221; – <em>Ben Walsh</em></p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The word on everybody's lips these days is Grexit.</p>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The word on everybody&#8217;s lips these days is Grexit &#8212; <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/13/eurodammerung-2/?smid=tw-NytimesKrugman&amp;seid=auto">Paul Krugman</a>, for one, reckons it could be here as early as June. But how would such a thing happen? The FT, in its otherwise excellent <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/175fcc8c-9b7f-11e1-8b36-00144feabdc0.html">Grexit explainer</a>, fudges that bit:</p>
<blockquote><p>Exit would occur because, without disbursements of additional loans, the government would run out of money to pay social security and public sector wages. In addition, the ECB could withhold needed funds from Greek banks, bringing them down. At this point Athens would need to pass a new currency law, redenominate all domestic contracts in a new drachma, impose exchange controls, secure the borders to limit capital flight and take steps to introduce a paper currency.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s true that Greece is currently running a substantial fiscal deficit, which is being funded by the EU. If the EU stopped disbursing loans, Greece by definition could not meet all of its obligations. But the thing that happens when you can&#8217;t meet your obligations is known as a default &#8212; and as we&#8217;ve already seen, Greece is more than capable of defaulting on its obligations without exiting the euro.</p>
<p>So the question is: given that leaving the euro would be political suicide for any Greek politician, why would any such politician go ahead and do it anyway?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/14/eu-greece-grexit-idUSL5E8GEBG920120514">Luke Baker</a> has the beginnings of an answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>The rules would appear to leave the decision largely in the hands of the departing country. But when asked if that were the case during a meeting in Brussels last week, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said it was not necessarily so.</p>
<p>According to a source present at the meeting, Schaeuble said contingency plans were being drawn up and indicated that life could be made so unpleasant for Greece that it would be left with no other option but to ask to leave.</p>
<p>That could involve shutting off all Greece&#8217;s official financing, not just from the euro zone&#8217;s EFSF bailout fund but from the European Central Bank too. Already there are signs of that sort of pressure being applied to Athens.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems obvious to me that if Greece were not receiving any money from the EU and the IMF, and the relationship there turned highly adversarial, with the EU effectively trying to force Greece out of the Eurozone, then Greece would feel no particular need to pay the EU what it is owed. And if Greece were to default to the EU, then at that point it would gain little from staying current on its other debts, too. It might still pay the IMF, and try to maintain some kind of decent relations there, but my guess is that Christine Lagarde would be foursquare behind Brussels, and the Greeks would see little point in paying her either.</p>
<p>Up until now, only pariah countries have defaulted to the IMF, but Greece is the exception to many rules. And given the choice between default and devaluation, it seems to me that Greek politicians &#8212; and the Greek population as a whole &#8212; clearly prefers the former to the latter.</p>
<p>Once you strip out Greece&#8217;s debt payments, the country&#8217;s primary deficit is pretty modest &#8212; just 1% of GDP or so. So could Greece make one more round of cuts, default on all its debts, and remain within the Eurozone?</p>
<p>I think the answer is no &#8212; and the reason is the banks. If the ECB were to stop funding the Greek banks, and if Greece were to default on its debts, all of Greece&#8217;s banks would be insolvent. And you can&#8217;t have a functioning economy without banks. Basically, Greek depositors need to be able to withdraw <em>something</em> from their checking accounts. And if the EU stops supporting the banks, that something can&#8217;t be euros any more.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ina Drew &#8212; the JP Morgan executive who famously <a href="http://mycrains.crainsnewyork.com/40under40/profiles/1993/ina-r-drew">&#8220;loves crises</a>&#8221; &#8212; is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/14/business/jpmorgan-chase-executive-to-resign-in-trading-debacle.html?_r=2&amp;emc=na">out</a>; it seems the buck for the $2 billion trading loss in her unit has stopped with her. And slowly, a few shapes are beginning to emerge from the fog of what exactly happened here.</p>
<p>For one thing, it&#8217;s becoming increasingly obvious that Drew got paid her eight-figure salary in return for being able to pull off a very neat trick: turning hedging operations into a profit center.</p>
<p>Drew&#8217;s Chief Investment Office <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-14/dimon-fortress-breached-as-push-from-hedging-to-betting-blows-up.html">quadrupled in size</a> between 2006 and 2011, reaching $356 billion in total, and it&#8217;s easy to see how that happened. On the one hand, it was incredibly profitable, with the London team alone, which oversaw some $200 billion, making $5 billion of profit in 2010, more than 25% of JP Morgan&#8217;s net income for the year. At the same time JP Morgan accumulated enormous new deposits in the wake of the financial crisis, both by acquiring banks and by attracting big new clients wanting the safety of a too-big-to-fail bank. Historically, JP Morgan has served big corporations by lending them money, but nowadays, as the cash balances on corporate balance sheets get ever more enormous, the main thing these companies want from JP Morgan is a simple checking account &#8212; one where they can be sure that their money is safe.</p>
<p>With lots of deposits coming in, and little corporate demand for loans, it was easy for all that money to find its way to the Chief Investment Office, which could take any amount of liabilities (deposits are liabilities, for a bank) and turn them into assets generating billions of dollars in profits.</p>
<p>But the CIO does much more than just provide profits for JP Morgan. In contrast to the bank&#8217;s lending book, the CIO is nimble. Loans, as a rule, have to be held to maturity: that&#8217;s the essence of relationship banking. Investments, by contrast, can be sold at any time. Of course, an investment which can be sold at any time has another name: it&#8217;s a trade. Thus did the CIO become home to big traders, making huge bets and huge bonuses.</p>
<p>In the past couple of years, of course, that raised its own set of problems: how could this group of traders possibly be Volcker-compliant? The answer lay in Drew&#8217;s love of crises: her incredibly valuable ability to prevent losses and even make profits when the world is falling apart. In that sense, the CIO was one big hedge, and in a narrower sense the CIO was the go-to office whenever JP Morgan saw a risk which needed hedging.</p>
<p><a href="http://markdow.tumblr.com/post/23033303291/was-jpm-hedging-unhedging-or-speculating">Mark Dow</a> has an intriguing thesis this morning:</p>
<blockquote><p>We know that over the last 2-3 quarters of 2011 we were gripped by the fear of a European financial meltdown and a second recession in the US.</p>
<p>We know that that the Fed’s swap lines and the ECB’s LTRO reversed this market view and crushed credit spreads lower, hurting those who had been buying protection in the previous months.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, it seems likely to me that the aggressive selling of protection we heard about in April 2012 was actually the <em>unwinding</em> of the hedge that had been accumulated in 2011 and was by then deeply underwater.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, Jamie Dimon, like everybody else, was worried about a Europe-induced financial crisis at the end of 2011, and so he told Drew to put on positions which would protect against such a crisis. She did so &#8212; only this time around, the crisis never happened, and Drew&#8217;s positions had to be unwound.</p>
<p><em>That&#8217;s</em> where things seem to have gone very, very wrong. Drew prided herself on turning every hedge into a profit center &#8212; having her cake and eating it too, basically. We&#8217;re deep in the realm of speculation, here, but it&#8217;s entirely possible that Drew positioned the CIO, at the end of 2011, to profit from a European meltdown. When that meltdown didn&#8217;t happen, simply selling those positions would involve realizing a substantial loss. And so rather than selling the positions, Drew decided to put on new, profitable positions which would offset the old hedge. Enter Bruno Iksil, the London Whale, and his enormous trade.</p>
<p>Iksil&#8217;s trade was fundamentally bullish, which would make sense for a trade designed to offset a fundamentally bearish hedge. Of course it wasn&#8217;t a perfect offset &#8212; there&#8217;s no such thing as a perfect hedge. Traders making multi-million-dollar bonuses don&#8217;t get paid to design perfect hedges, in any case. Iksil was being paid to put on a trade which would make money for the CIO, even as it was also hedging existing positions.</p>
<p>As with all imperfect hedges, however, especially when they&#8217;re big and public, the market can always move against you in exactly the way you don&#8217;t want. We don&#8217;t know the details of Iksil&#8217;s trade, but let&#8217;s say that the big underlying position was a bearish position in cash bonds, while Iksil&#8217;s trade involved a bullish position in the CDS market. In April, the cash and CDS markets stopped mirroring each other, and started behaving very oddly &#8212; you&#8217;d see bullish moves in cash bonds, combined with bearish moves in the CDS market. That combination, it seems, turned out to be the one thing that JP Morgan wasn&#8217;t hedged against, and the losses in the CIO started mounting rapidly.</p>
<p>How did Iksil&#8217;s trade go so horribly, massively, wrong? Partly it&#8217;s because his position was so big and so public. When hedge funds worked out what he was doing, they managed to get the word out, using stories in <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-05/jpmorgan-trader-iksil-s-heft-is-said-to-distort-credit-indexes.html">Bloomberg</a> and the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303299604577326031119412436.html?mod=wsj_share_tweet">WSJ</a>. And then it was just a matter of watching the market do what it always does, when it smells blood: I&#8217;m told that Boaz Weinstein&#8217;s Saba, for one, made a lot of money taking the other side of Iksil&#8217;s trade.</p>
<p>Taking a much bigger-picture view, however, what was really going on here was that JP Morgan had hundreds of billions of dollars in excess deposits, thanks to its too-big-to-fail status. And rather than lending out that money and boosting the economy, Jamie Dimon decided to simply play with it in financial markets, just as a hedge fund would. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-14/dimon-fortress-breached-as-push-from-hedging-to-betting-blows-up.html">Bloomberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dimon pushed Drew’s unit, which invests deposits the bank hasn’t loaned, to seek profit by speculating on higher-yielding assets such as credit derivatives, according to five former executives. The CEO suggested positions, a current executive said.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s always dangerous when a CEO suggests positions for an internal hedge fund to take, because the CEO by definition has no risk manager with enough authority to effectively constrain him. Dimon is powerful and secure enough that he&#8217;s not going to lose his job over this. But he probably should. Partly because the bank&#8217;s risk-management procedures were so weak that a $2 billion loss could suddenly appear out of nowhere. Partly because Dimon became too cocky, and started thinking that his job was to trade the bank&#8217;s billions for profit. But mainly because he&#8217;s lost sight of what JP Morgan has to be, in a post-crisis world.</p>
<p>Those excess deposits weren&#8217;t gifted to Dimon on a plate so that he could gamble them on the CDX NA IG 9. Rather, Dimon&#8217;s job is to take those deposits and lend them productively into the real economy. Every extra dollar in the CIO is a sign of his failure to do that. And the $2 billion loss is really just a symptom of what happens when banks get too much money, and don&#8217;t really know what to do with it all.</p>

He hasn’t returned Bloomberg’s calls, either, and neither is he quoted in Michelle Celarier’s story in the NY Post.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kenneth Dam is an unusually reticent professor. Since he released his <a title="11 - Dam Amicus.pdf" href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/files/2012/05/11-Dam-Amicus.pdf">amicus brief</a> in the <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/04/10/argentina-elliott-and-the-pari-passu-war/">case</a> of Elliott vs. Argentina, I&#8217;ve phoned him and sent him multiple emails to two different addresses, but have received no reply at all. Which is odd, because he clearly feels very strongly about the case &#8212; strongly enough to enlist Kevin Reed, of the white-shoe law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan, to put together his brief and submit it to the Second Circuit.</p>
<p>Such services don&#8217;t come cheap: my guess is that Reed charged Dam well into six figures for his services.</p>
<p>So why would Dam spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to submit an amicus brief in this case, yet at the same time evince no interest in talking to the press about it? He <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-11/elliott-argentine-bond-bid-wins-vote-of-ex-bush-official.html">hasn&#8217;t returned</a> Bloomberg&#8217;s calls, either, and neither is he quoted in <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/argentine_beef_rfdUpJSVH5QL6rgpICFdOK">Michelle Celarier&#8217;s story</a> in the NY Post. But Celarier has managed to come out and say what many of us suspected, when we first saw the brief:</p>
<blockquote><p>Elliott Capital Management’s Paul Singer must be sweating it&#8230;</p>
<p>Singer has enlisted the support of ex-Treasury vet Kenneth Dam, who served under Ronald Reagan and was deputy secretary of the Treasury under George W. Bush, to write a “friends of the court” brief for Elliott in a case the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is slated to hear later this month.</p></blockquote>
<p>This wouldn&#8217;t be the first time that Elliott paid a venerable law professor to submit a brief in support of its case. But in this particular brief, there&#8217;s an unambiguous footnote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pursuant to Local Rule 29.1, Kenneth W. Dam states that he authored this brief and that it was not authored or funded by any party to this action.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the off chance that you&#8217;re not familiar with <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/clerk/Rules/LR/Local_Rule_29_1.htm">Local Rule 29.1</a>, it requires a disclosure statement under <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/clerk/Rules/FRAP/Rule_29.htm">FRAP 29(c)(5)</a>, which in turn says that this footnote must indicate whether &#8220;a person — other than the amicus curiae, its members, or its counsel — contributed money that was intended to fund preparing or submitting the brief and, if so, identifies each such person&#8221;. Since Dam identifies no such person, I would normally conclude that he paid the costs of preparing and submitting this brief himself.</p>
<p>But Michelle Celarier is a veteran and very well-sourced journalist, and if she says that Dam&#8217;s brief was commissioned by Elliott, I&#8217;m inclined to believe her.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all very peculiar. Within the brief itself, Dam&#8217;s only declared interest is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Prof. Dam has a substantial interest in the outcome of this action because it presents issues involving the international financial markets, the role of international financial institutions, and U.S. international policymaking that he has written on and studied extensively.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which might explain why he&#8217;s interested in the outcome of the action, but doesn&#8217;t come close to explaining why he&#8217;s willing to spend a very large amount of money attempting to <em>influence</em> the outcome of the action.</p>
<p>All of this could be cleared up, of course, very easily, if only Dam or Elliott were willing to answer some simple questions. But instead we get this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dam didn’t return a phone message and e-mail sent to his law school office seeking comment on the filing. Peter Truell, a spokesman for New York-based Elliott Management, declined to comment.</p></blockquote>
<p>I first tried to ask Dam about this back on May 2, and then tried again on May 7. So far, I&#8217;ve heard nothing. So if anybody out there knows Ken Dam, and gets the opportunity to ask him a simple question, I&#8217;d be much obliged if you could ask him whether he&#8217;s working for Elliott. Then, if he says yes, ask him why he didn&#8217;t say so in his brief. And if he says no, ask him how much it cost to file this brief, and whether he personally paid the full sum. I&#8217;d be fascinated to learn what his answers are.</p>

<p>It turns out we probably should <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/04/09/counterparties-should-we-fear-voldemort/">fear Voldemort</a>. Yesterday Jamie Dimon hastily scheduled a 5 p.m. conference call in which he was forced to explain a sudden <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304070304577396511420792008.html?mod=WSJ_Home_largeHeadline">$2 billion loss</a> in his Chief Investment Office, a division that was supposed to safely hedge the bank&#8217;s risk.</p>
<p>JPMorgan&#8217;s stock fell more than 9% on the news. Dimon, who last month called the issue a &#8220;tempest in a teapot&#8221;, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304543904577396671503143532.html">said</a> the hedges implemented by the &#8220;London Whale&#8221; (aka Bruno Iksil) were a &#8220;bad strategy,  executed poorly&#8221;; he also conceded &#8220;many errors&#8221;, &#8220;sloppiness&#8221; and &#8220;bad  judgement&#8221;.</p>
<p>The responsibility for mistakes ultimately rests on Dimon&#8217;s shoulders. Jonathan Weil <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-11/what-jamie-dimon-doesn-t-know-is-plain-scary.html">noted</a> that yesterday&#8217;s disclosures meant that &#8220;either Dimon misled the public  about the gravity of the festering trades during his company’s  first-quarter earnings call last month. Or he didn’t know what was  happening inside the bowels of his own company.&#8221; Barney Frank didn&#8217;t let this opportunity pass him by, either, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/money/la-fi-mo-sec-jpmorgan-chase-regulators-20120511,0,3897661.story">saying</a> that &#8220;JPMorgan Chase, entirely without any help from the government, has lost,  in this one set of transactions, five times the amount they claim  financial regulation is costing them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adding to Dimon&#8217;s chagrin was his acknowledgement in yesterday&#8217;s conference call that he <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/05/10/a-shock-from-jpmorgan-is-new-fodder-for-reformers/?ref=business">gave proponents</a> of increased financial regulation, including Barney Frank, yet another proof point. As <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/05/10/jp-morgan-when-basis-trades-blow-up/">Felix</a> notes, the strong likelihood that the trades were Volcker-compliant  &#8220;only goes to show how weak the Volcker Rule&#8221; is and affirms the need  for &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/05/11/how-dumb-rules-can-mitigate-model-risk/">dumb rules</a>&#8221; that traders can&#8217;t easily game.</p>
<p>So just what specifically went wrong? For a deep and wonky explanation, Lisa Pollack details what might have been <a href="http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2012/05/11/996131/too-big-to-hedge/">going on</a> and concludes that both regulators and Dimon should have seen the  buildup of risk, if not the losses, long before yesterday. Heidi Moore also has a handy guide that spells out exactly <a href="http://marketplace.org/topics/business/easy-street/jp-morgans-loss-explainer#.T60fG7ppJTE.twitter">what happened</a> in non-financial English. Zero Hedge <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/santelli-cds-regulation-and-why-bank-analysts-failed">outlines</a> how analysts need to change how they examine the profitability of big banks, and their hedging business model.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still some dispute over whether Iksil&#8217;s positions were actually a hedge or just a disguised bet. Matt Levine has an <a href="http://dealbreaker.com/2012/05/the-tale-of-a-whale-of-a-fail/">extended take</a> on this, and before the latest revelations the Epicurean Dealmaker <a href="http://epicureandealmaker.blogspot.com/2012/04/good-offense.html">pointed out</a> that the difference between a hedge and speculation is subtle because &#8220;the same trade or financial     instrument can be used in either way at different times and under     different circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chief among Iksil&#8217;s errors, it seems, was a  model that didn&#8217;t <a href="http://dealbreaker.com/2012/05/whale-sushi-on-the-menu-at-jpmorgan-executive-lunchroom-for-next-few-months/">accurately capture</a> the risk of the strategy. The CDS index Iksil was selling protection on  has moved away from him recently, but why JPMorgan&#8217;s losses were so  large relative to the index&#8217;s more modest change remains <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/05/11/chart-of-the-day-the-cdx-na-ig-9-basis/">unclear</a>. Derivatives are a zero-sum game, of course, and at least two <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2012/05/11/hedge-funds-profit-as-j-p-morgan-sees-losses/">hedge funds run by mostly ex-JPMers</a> have made some $30 million each.</p>
<p>For his part, Dimon is far from finished explaining what went wrong,  and we won&#8217;t have to wait long for his next attempt. On Wednesday, he  taped an interview with NBC&#8217;s David Gregory to air on Sunday&#8217;s <em>Meet the Press</em>. After yesterday&#8217;s announcement, Dimon has decided to <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/05/11/dimons-meet-the-press-appearance-mired-in-controversy/">retape</a> the appearance. – <em>Ben Walsh</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/files/2012/05/tumblr_m3x7ybSKEM1qa8osno1_1280.jpg" width="581" height="414" alt="tumblr_m3x7ybSKEM1qa8osno1_1280.jpg" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the chart you&#8217;ve all been waiting for, courtesy of Reuters&#8217;s very own Scotty Barber: the spread on the CDX NA IG 9 index &#8212; the synthetic index on which JP Morgan&#8217;s Bruno Iskil was selling enormous amounts of protection &#8212; minus the spread on the index&#8217;s constituent bonds.</p>
<p>Three things jump out here. Firstly, the basis is negative, not positive. That means that the obvious trade was to buy the underlying bonds and hedge by buying protection on the index. That obvious trade, if held to maturity, should always make money. Iksil was funding that trade, by selling protection on the index.</p>
<p>Secondly, the chart is going up and to the right. Since Iksil was selling protection, that means the market was moving against him. Or, to put it another way, the obvious trade makes money when it expires at zero, and as the chart moves towards zero, Iksil loses money on a mark-to-market basis.</p>
<p>Finally, the move doesn&#8217;t seem to be all that huge &#8212; only about 30bp in this quarter. Which doesn&#8217;t seem remotely enough to cause a $2 billion loss. Still, Iksil managed it somehow.</p>
<p><b><i>Update</i></b>: Many thanks to <a href="http://sallykohn.tumblr.com/post/22913146013/i-dont-understand-this-chart-at-all-something">Sally Kohn</a> for making the chart infinitely better by putting whales on it.</p>
