refactoring:
	- move toward true blackboard pattern
		- remove the central core controller. Every strategy is now a listener to the data collector.
			- every strategy needs a database wrapper, dictionary (reuse)
		- create broadcast system instead of listener registration.
	- improve multiprocessing
		- provided by having strategies as separate nodes
		- move away from twisted for threading within the strategies
